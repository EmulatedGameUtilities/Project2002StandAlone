This UI is intended to skin the new default UI to look like the old default UI
using as few files as possible. If everyone who prefers the old default would
use this UI instead, fewer UIs would break on patch day.

This UI is intended to be a starting point for UI customization. Extract the
files into a custom UI folder, then apply old UI modifications into the folder
as you normally would.
