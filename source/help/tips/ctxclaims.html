<br><br>
This window is used to claim special features which have been 
granted to your account.  A feature consists of one or more items which 
will be put into the inventory of whichever character you choose.  Each 
feature can only be claimed once on a single character on this account, so 
choose carefully which character you would like to have the items.
<br><br>
The list on the left side of the window contains the features you are 
eligible to claim.  When you select one, the list on the right side will 
show all of the items the character will receive if they claim the 
feature.  You can right-click any item to display it.
<br><br>
The <c "#66CCFF">Refresh</C> button will ask the server to update your list of 
features.
<br><br>
The <c "#66CCFF">Claim</C> button will attempt to claim the selected feature.  You will 
be given a confirmation message to verify that you would like to make the claim 
on this character.
<br><br>
The <c "#66CCFF">Cancel</C> button will close the window without claiming any features.
<br><br>
You can bring up the Claim Window at any time by selecting the 
Claims option in the EQ menu, by using the default keypress 
&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;C&gt;, or by typing /claim.
