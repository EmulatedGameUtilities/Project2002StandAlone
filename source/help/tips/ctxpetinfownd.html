<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF">Introduction:</c><br>
- The pet info window allows you to fully control your pet.<br>
- The pet info window lets you view:<br>
  Your pet's health.<br>
  Your pet's target and pet target's health.<br>
  Buffs that are on your pet.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">UI Customization:</c><br>
- You can customize which buttons contain which commands by right clicking on the button and selecting what you want to go in its place.  If the button you assign already exists in another button slot, the other slot will be set to "none" which essentially does nothing when clicked on.<br>
<br>
- Pet button states which can be on or off (for example taunt) can be toggled by clicking on the corresponding button.<br>
- Pet buttons can be right clicked on and dragged to the hot button bar.<br>
- Toggle-able buttons will simultaneously be on or off in coordination with the buttons in the pet window.<br>
- Pet text based commands can be used to perform the same functionality as the buttons.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">Pet Text Based Commands:</c><br>
- Pet toggleable states can be swapped by using the text command /pet <command> off|on.<br>
- You can use /pet <command> to toggle the command from its current state.<br>
- An example of a text based command would be /pet follow me.<br>
