- <c "#66CCFF">Active flag</c> - The "active" status of a member describes whether that member is participating in the Guild Tribute Benefits selected for your Guild.  Note that, even if you have opted-in, you cannot receive Guild Tribute benefits while in Shroud form.  Your "active" status should show in <c "#FFFF00">yellow</c> while in Shroud form, and your guild will not be charged since you won't be receiving the benefits.
