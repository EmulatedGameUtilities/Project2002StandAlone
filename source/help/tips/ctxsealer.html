- To apply an Augmentation Item to a slot on a piece of equipment, you 
will need to use the Augmentation Sealer. There is one at each Adventure camp. 
Place the Augmentation Item and the compatible piece of equipment into the open 
slots of the Augmentation Sealer and click "Combine." Your new augmented item 
will be created!

- If you wish to remove the Augmentation Item, you can buy distillers and/or solvents at the Adventure Merchants.
<BR>
- Solvents destroy the Augment Item to remove it from your equipment.  Solvents are available based on the slot number.  For example, a Slot 1 Solvent will remove any Augmentation Item from Slot 1 of your equipment.  Take your item with the Augmentation Item you wish to remove and the appropriate solvent and put them into the Augmentation Sealer. Select the Augmentation Item you wish to remove, then click "Delete." The Augmentation Item will be removed and destroyed. So, be careful not to misuse your Augmentation Items! 
<BR>
- Distillers can remove the Augment Item from your equipment without destroying the Augment Item. Distillers are available based on the class of Augmentation Distiller required by the Augment Item.  For example, a Class VI Augmentation Distiller will remove an Augmentation Item requiring Class VI Augmentation Distiller for safe removal.   Take your equipment with the Augmentation Item you wish to remove and the appropriate distiller and put them into the Augmentation Sealer. Click "Remove." The Augmentation Item will be removed and returned to you along with the equipment.
