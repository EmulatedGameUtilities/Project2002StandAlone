EverQuest(R): Gates of Discord(tm) -- coming soon!

To minimize the size of your patch on launch day, we suggest that you start 
to download the necessary files as they come available by selecting the 
appropriate radio button below. You will be able to change your selection 
using the Advanced Options screen. We won't charge you for downloading the 
files; however, you will need to purchase EverQuest(R): Gates of Discord(tm)
in order to play in the expansion.
