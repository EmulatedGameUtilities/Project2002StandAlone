Brewing - Skill needed - Int or Wis<br>
<br>
Expected cost 300pp. Time.. about 6 hours depending on Int/Wisdom<br>
<br>
1. Make "Skull ale" - vinegar, spices, short beer, cyclops skull ( http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2791 returned on success or failure) - trivial 151.<br>
<br>
2. Make "Faydwer shaker" elven wine, gnomish spirits, dwarven ale, mead (failure yields cask + 4 bottles, success yields 1 shaker and 4 bottles) with a cask - trivial 188<br>
I found freeport the best spot (http://www.eqtraders.com/location/freeport.htm) as all 4 drink components sold near the jetty<br>
<br>
3. Make "Minotaur Hero's Brew" - 3 malt, yeast, 2 flask water, 2 short beer (success yields 1 brew and 2 empty bottles, failure yields 1 cask and 2 empty bottles) with a cask - trivial 248<br>
I found Ak'anon (http://www.eqtraders.com/location/akanon.htm) the best spot <br>
