The story line of this quest has you find Tanik once in order to get information and then again a second time in order to give him the Vial of Velium Vapors. Given the difficulty and danger involved to someone who is KOS to giants, however, I recommend coming prepared the first time and doing all of your business with Tanik in one trip - go to see Frundle Frenkler and do her subquest before you go hunting for Tanik, and you will have a much easier time of it. <br><br>

========================  <br><br>

NPC TEXT  <br><br>

Ask LOREMASTER BORANNIN "What is brewing?" <br><br>

Loremaster Borannin says, "Ahh yes, good to see you again Yournamehere. I wish it were under better circumstances that we meet today. For some time now we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil is one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and has not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?" <br><br>

You say, "I will accept this mission." <br><br>

Loremaster Borannin says, "The council will be pleased to hear of your acceptance, Yournamehere. Scour the regions surrounding the city of the Giants. Discover what happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell protect you." <br><br>

========================  <br><br>

Now we head on out to find Tanik. Be careful not to confuse him with Tain Hammerfrost who spawns in a similar manner near the Iceclad bridge but is for a completely unrelated quest. You will only find our Tanik very close to Kael. Simply run up and down the ramp that leads down into Kael from East Wastes, and on the surface ground level along either side of the ramp. When you do this, eventually you'll hit the right spot and one of two things will happen. Either you will see a message saying "You stumble over a pile of snow exposing a Coldain!" and Tanik will appear lying on the ground, or you will get a message saying "You have been ambushed!" and the Kromrif Death Squad will appear and chop you into tiny bits. The Death Squad consists of two to six giants of approximately level 50. They are on Kromrif faction which means that the safest way to find them is to be non-kos to the Kromrif giants or to let a non-kos friend do the triggering. Just be careful that your friend is also non-kos to the coldain or can feign when they find Tanik. <br><br>

If you are doing the triggering yourself you might want to make sure you know the way down from the ramp to the zone into Kael, and you definitely want to have jboots or SoW, just in case. Even if you are KOS in Kael you can safely zone in as long as you don't take more than a few steps inside and as long as no one has pulled a train there. I triggered the giants once by accident and blew them away with 55 shaman SoW, but not everyone has that luxury. Be on your toes if you're working with jboots speed or less, the zone isn't close enough to survive being beaten on the whole way. Also note that Tanik despawns pretty quickly if you don't deal with him right away. I'm told that if you happen to trigger both Tanik and the giants at the same time, Tanik despawns before the giants do...so move carefully and stop the instant one spawns. You can't count on feign or running to the zone to keep you alive to get Tanik before he goes poof. <br><br>

If you keep getting a lot of giants but no Tanik, you just need to keep trying. That means that you are hitting the right spots but they have all just happened to be giants rather than Tanik. Keep at it, you'll get him. However, if you are having trouble getting anything at all, the first thing to try is moving slower. While you're nuts to try this while KOS to giants and without a SoW, it's possible that you can run right over the right spot without triggering it if you are moving too fast. Try pausing every couple steps. If that fails you, there is another approach you can use. Basically, there are "invisible men" npcs scattered around the area. When you get close enough to one of them, they emote the message that you see and trigger the spawning of either Tanik or the Death Squad. These invisible npcs cannot be tracked or seen with any see invis spells and are not traps that rogues can sense or disarm. However, as any pet owner knows, when you tell your pet (other than summoned enchanter pets who obey no one) to guard a spot "/pet guard here" they not only stay in that spot but they also turn to face the nearest non-pet NPC. See where this is going? A charmed snow bunny can find these things that none of the rest of us can detect. Either make a pet or charm a pet or bring someone with a pet and put the pet on guard at the top of the ramp. It will swing to face where the nearest trigger npc awaits. (Make sure that there aren't any other creatures closer to you than the archway at the bottom of the ramp to Kael.) You then take a few steps in that direction and bring your pet up to you, park them again to check your direction, and take a few steps, etc. <br><br>

If that's not going well, try the following locs that usually have traps, as reported by Winterbreath on the message boards: <br>
-6896, 4406 (south of the ramp) <br>
-6759,4112 (south of the ramp) <br>
-6294,4397 (near the bottom of the ramp) <br>
-6088,3564 (at the top of the ramp) <br><br>

It used to be possible to determine whether you had Tanik or the giants by clicking in the direction of the trap once you'd found it and not yet triggered it. Recent changes in the way invisibility affects trades have eliminated that option, so don't bother clicking around with a coin anymore. Just trigger the trap and see which you've got. <br><br>

Reports are that you might get really lucky finding Tanik or you might curse the day you heard that shrimp's name. I got two Taniks in a row right off when doing this for myself along with a friend doing his. Others have gotten 20 Death Squads before Tanik would show his face. When he does finally put in an appearance, be very careful not to go all the way through the quest text with him if you want to give him the Vial of Velium Vapors the first time you find him...he will despawn if you ask him "What are Velium Vapors?". You can either go through the conversation up to that point, or just give him the vial without saying a word, and he will give you the note you need. <br><br>

========================  <br><br>

You say, "HAIL, TANIK GRESKIL"  <br><br>

Tanik Greskil says, "Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly hurt and need your help." <br><br>

You say, "I will help you." <br><br>

Tanik Greskil says, "Quickly, give me a vial of Velium Vapors so I can return home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics." 
(Note: Tanik will despawn if you ask the next question in the conversation, so don't ask him about the Velium Vapors if you wish to give them to him at this point.) <br><br>

You say, "What are Velium Vapors?" <br><br>

Tanik Greskil says, "Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you? Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. I will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep from being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope."  (Tanik despawns) <br><br>

========================  <br><br>

Go to Frundle Frenkler in Thurgadin. She is located at approximately -350, 500. To get to her from the bank, head like you are going to the Temple of Lore. As you go down the ramp towards the creepy statue, on the left are three buildings. Frundle is in the middle building. She will not respond to a Hail, but when you ask her about velium vapors she gives you the Velium Purifier that you need. <br><br>

You say, 'Hail FRUNDLE FRENKLER'  <br><br>

You say, 'What are Velium Vapors?'  <br><br>

Frundle Frenkler says, "Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a VELIUM VIAL, then combine the vial with TWO SMALL PIECES OF VELIUM in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret." <br><br>

Receive: Velium Purifier  <br><br>

You say, "What is a velium vial?" <br><br>

Frundle Frenkler says "I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a SMALL BRICK OF VELIUM, THREE CRYSTALLINE SILKS, and TWO GLASS SHARDS. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet." <br><br>

This means you need two small pieces of velium, a small brick of velium, and three crystalline silks. If you are level 50+, you can get all of these along with some experience by hunting the spiders in Velketor's Labyrinth. If you are lower than that or don't want to fight for a group in Velks, head to Crystal Caverns. Kill orc miners for the velium. The small pieces of velium are the stackable kind, make sure to get two. The bricks are not stackable, but you only need one. It might take you 20-30 orcs but they're plentiful in there, so if you're in the area just suck it up and kill or auction to buy from those who are killing them for experience. There tends to be folks farming them for ore at any given time, however, so auctioning might not get you much. For silks, drop down to the bottom of the orc area and find the path over to the spider area. It's a little tricky down there, so you might want to have someone show you the way. You will get the crystalline silks very quickly off of the spiders. When you have these things together, go back to Thurgadin. <br><br>

Combine in a Pottery Wheel: 1 Small Brick of Velium + 3 Crystalline Silks + 2 Glass Shards = Unfired Velium Vial. (trivial <123) <br>
Combine in a Kiln: Unfired Velium Vial + High Quality Firing Sheet = Veluim Vial. (trivial 122) <br>
Yes, they misspelled the word Velium in "Veluim Vial".  <br><br>

Combine in Velium Purifier: 2 Small Pieces of Velium + Veluim Vial = Vial of Velium Vapors. (never fails) <br><br>

Yes, this item has one charge of Gate: Thurgadin on it. Tanik wants it so that he can gate home, but you can also make it in order to gate yourself to Thurgadin, much to the dismay of alchemists who have gate potions they'd love to sell you but can't even begin to compete with the price of these. <br><br>

Note about Faction: All reports indicate that this is the step where faction might start to be an issue for you if the coldain don't already love you. Frundle will not talk to you unless you are at least indifferent. It is possible that steps prior to this require you to be at least apprehensive, or that steps after this require you to be at least amiable or kindly. I finished at kindly so I do know that is enough to get you at least through the seventh shawl. At any rate, please keep in mind the nature of the task with which the coldain are entrusting us. We are being told ancient secrets of their race in order to craft increasingly sacred artifacts. They'd be loony to let anyone know these things if they weren't a good buddy. So don't take it personally.  <br><br>

========================  <br><br>

Give Tanik: Vial of Velium Vapors Tanik Greskil says "Thank you, Yournamehere. I shall be eternally grateful to you. Should you ever require my assistance I pledge to you my aid. Please deliver this to Borannin, it is imperative that he deliver this to the Dain at once. Farewell for now outlander...." <br><br>

Receive: Tanik's Note  <br><br>

Take the note back to Borannin in Thurgadin and give him TANIK'S NOTE & WOVEN COLDAIN PRAYER SHAWL  <br><br>

Loremaster Borannin says "Words cannot express our gratitude for your deeds outlander, you have saved a hero of our people from certain death. Please accept this, the FUR-LINED SHAWL, as a token of our sincere appreciation. You are indeed among the most highly regarded Yourracehere to set foot in Thurgadin. The next time we meet be sure to ask me how to further advance your reputation with the coldain." <br><br>

Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br> 
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse  <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse  <br>
You gain experience!! <br><br>

Receive: FUR-LINED COLDAIN PRAYER SHAWL  <br><br>
