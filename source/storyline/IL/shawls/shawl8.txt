NPC TEXT <br><br>
*ALERT*: READ THE WARNING BELOW before you give your shawl to ANY Coldain associated with the Eighth Shawl. If you give your shawl to certain Coldain before the Dain has been summoned, you may lose your ability to summon the Dain entirely, meaning you will have to wait for him to spawn on his own and nab him before he's killed. The (Original) and (Approved) notes throughout the NPC Text are related to this issue.   <br><br>
Give Loremaster Borannin: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (Original)  <br><br>

Loremaster Borannin says, "Incredible! Never before has an outlander been skilled and determined enough to craft our sacred rune. You are now worthy of the Dain’s most perilous task. You should seek an audience with the Dain immediately. Show him your Runed Prayer Shawl; he will give you the task that has been prepared for you. If the Dain is away show your Shawl to Chamberlain Krystorf and he will call for him."  <br><br>

Receive: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (Original)   <br><br>
If the Dain is not up...  <br><br>

Give Chamberlain Krystorf: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (Original)  <br><br>

Receive: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (Approved)  <br><br>
You say, "Hail, Dain Frostreaver IV"  <br><br>

Chamberlain Krystorf says, "YOU do not speak to the Dain so formally, Barbarian! Maybe you should return to our temple to learn more of proper custom when in the presence of a Dain of Thurgadin."  <br><br>

Give Dain Frostreaver IV: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (either Original or Approved)  <br><br>

Dain Frostweaver IV says, "Ah Yournamehere. I was hoping to see you. We require your skilled hand. The Armory is overtaxed preparing armor for the war that we are preparing to wage on the Giants of Zek. We need you to help by creating some Field Plate for a mission that is near to execution. Go see Loremaster Solstrin in the Hall of Ancestors, give him these orders. He holds the lore recorded on how to make the field plate."  <br><br>

Receive: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (Approved) & Royal Coldain Orders  <br><br>
Give Loremaster Solstrin: Royal Coldain Orders  <br><br>

Loremaster Solstrin says, "So, the Dain needs your assistance with the Field Plate. The Dain must trust you a great deal to impart the wisdom of our armor creation to you. Here are the tomes. The first details how to make the basic armor, the other details how to begin working with gemstones. If the Dain is asking you for them you should place them in an Issue Kit. May Brell guide your hand friend, good luck to you."  <br><br>

Receive: FORGE OF ICEWELL KEEP & PRECIOUS GEM STUDY   <br><br>
You say, "What about working with gemstones?"  <br><br>

Loremaster Solstrin says, "Aye, gems are placed within the armor. Brell is pleased with this fusion of ore and gem. The combination produces a sturdy piece of armor. You will need some Etching Tools to work with the gems. If you ask Meg Tucter for a set, she should have some lying about."  <br><br>

You say, "What about the issue kit?"  <br><br>

Loremaster Solstrin says, "The Standard Issue Kit is what we issue to soldiers at the beginning of their mission. I have this empty one here. Before I give it to you, could you show me your Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl? I would like to see how skilled you are.'  <br><br>

Give Loremaster Solstrin: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (either Original or Approved)  <br><br>

Loremaster Solstrin says, "Amazing, your skill is truly great. I am sorry that I had doubted you. Here is the empty Issue Kit. Place a full set of Imbued Royal Velium armor in it before giving it to the Dain."  <br><br>

Receive: Issue Kit & Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (Approved)   <br><br>
You say, "I need a set of Etching Tools"  <br><br>

Meg Tucter says, "Oh, really? There are not many that work in faceting gems. I am surprised to see your interest. You can have this old set of mine. There is no need to return the tools, Talem recently made me a new sturdy set. Brell bless him."  <br><br>

Receive: Etching Tools   <br><br>
Note: Click COMBINE on the box before handing it to the Dain!   <br><br>
Give Dain Frostreaver IV: Coldain Standard Issue Kit  <br><br>

Dain Frostreaver IV says, "Excellent work Yournamehere. If I didn't know I would assume this was made by our most skilled artisans. You must hurry, General Bragmur has formed camp in Iceclad. Take the kit to the General, he had to drudge forward without any armor. His mission must be a success if we hope to successfully defend Thurgadin against the Giants."  <br><br>

Receive: Approved Issuing Box   <br><br>
You say, "What mission?"  <br><br>

Dain Frostreaver IV says, "After General Bragmur has equipped the armor you have created for him, give him these orders. He is a skilled diplomat and will need to reach the pirate Gnomes. We must enter into a pact with them. We will supply them with the velium that they need to build their silly gadgets, and they will take their ship back to Antonica and call for reinforcements from our ancestors. We hope they will accept this pact, after all Brell has been known to align himself with Bristlebane whom the Gnomes of Iceclad follow. You may be an important factor in their success."  <br><br>

Receive: Expedition Orders  <br><br>
You say, "What factor?"  <br><br>

Dain Frostreaver IV says, "I fear that spies lurk in every corner. You may need to help the General reach the gnomish camp if the Kromrif has gotten word of our efforts. You should call on any allies that you have to assist in case they ambush you. Brell bless you Yournamehere, good luck."   <br><br>
You say, "Hail, General Bragmur"  <br><br>

General Bragmur says, "Please keep yer voice down I am busy here. If you do not mind I would ask that ya kindly leave."  <br><br>

Give General Bragmur: Approved Issuing Box  <br><br>

General Bragmur begins to put the armor, "Finally the Dain has gotten word of my arrival here. I await his final orders before proceeding."   <br><br>
Give General Bragmur: Expedition Orders  <br><br>

General Bragmur says, "The final orders, follow me closely! I pray that the Kromrif have not learned of our plans to align with the gnomes."   <br><br>
{General wanders off, waves of fighting with wolves and giants ensue....}   <br><br>
Commander Vjorik shouts, "The tracking wolves have found the Coldain! To the South West, Charge him!"  <br><br>
Commander Kvarid's corpse shouts, "Arghhhh! Though you have felled me your plans shall not succeed! Rallos will destroy you all for invading our lands!"   <br><br>
========================  <br><br>
GENERAL BRAGMUR: You will find him to start the action at -3400, 9000 in Iceclad. He is a permanent fixture, not triggered by your conversation with the Dain. If you happen to catch him shortly after someone else has killed him or completed the quest, his respawn is about four hours. Your mission is to travel across Iceclad with him, fighting off special wolves and giants that will ambush you along the way. He has a long history of problems with his pathing but has behaved much better since some recent tweaks. He will no longer get stuck under islands, preferring instead to swim around them. He does still sometimes vanish and then reappear a short way back or ahead on the path, sometimes even returning to his spawn point, so you might find a tracker reassuring in case you can't see where the General went. The other essential crew member is someone who can Memory Blur in case someone accidentally agros him during a fight. It is possible to bring KOS people along but it will cause additional hassles. You need to be sure they understand that they need to stay away from the General as much as possible, and that your chanters keep a close eye for the need to mem blur.  <br><br>
There is one other issue to watch for as well. When the various wolves and giants spawn, they might be placed such that they all agro on party members and none on the General. If this happens, the General will continue along on his merry way, oblivious to the sudden bloodshed. You must be prepared for this by making sure that at least someone in your party is watching the General and can keep him close until the fight is over. Your feigner and/or Memory Blur person might be good choices here. The General will keep walking as soon as the fight ends so feel free to delay him until your party has a chance to recover. He cannot be charmed in order to buff him. You also cannot agro him and run him to the end of the path without having the fights. He must walk on his own and trigger each attack in order for the Avatar of Brell to appear at the end to grant you your new shawl. The General himself is reasonably tough and should be able to hold up under attack until your tanks get a chance to pull stuff off of him. He'll be doing some good damage, as well.  <br><br>
As you travel, you will encounter five waves of attack from the giants and their wolves, some harder than others. Three coordinated groups of 55+ are required at the very barest minimum. Remember that you will also be agroed by all the green wolves and giants and obnoxious dervishes that you encounter along the way. It might be smart to have a few folks as the designated greenie brigade to help keep them out of everyone else's hair while fighting the real attacks. Please give those nasty dervishes a whack for me while you're at it. You may also wish to walk the path ahead of time through all of the locs indicated below, so that you know where the General should be going and are prepared for each fight.  <br><br>
First Wave: (-3550, 7550) 4 Kromriff Tracking Wolves spawn and attack. These cannot be charmed, snared or rooted. Stuns should work. Some reports say they're mezzable, some say they're immune. They're not terribly difficult.  <br><br>
Second Wave: (-2200, 7250) 4 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. They cannot be mezzed. They hit for 178 max and should be easily dispatched.  <br><br>
Third Wave: (-1100, 5950) Commander Kvarid and 3 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. They cannot be stunned, mezzed, rooted or snared. The Frost Giant Skirmishers are 55ish, and Commander Kvarid is 57.  <br><br>
Fourth Wave: (1500, 2250) 5 Kromriff Tracking Wolves spawn and attack. Same rules apply as on the wolves in the first wave.  <br><br>
Fifth Wave: (3700, 2650) Commander Vjorik and 5 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. Same rules apply as on the giants in the third wave.  <br><br>
The various wolves and giants that you will fight during this process also drop some very nice gear. Possible goodies include:  <br><br>
Snowchipper: 1HS 10/20, AC 5, str/sta/dex 5, sv cold 10, 3% to parry, weight 4.0, recommended level 51, war,rog,brd,shd,pal,rng/all <br><br>

========================  <br><br>
{...when you've successfully reached the gnomes...}   <br><br>
General Bragmur says, "Lo there gnomes! Tell me is your camp located nearby?"  <br><br>

Ratop says, "Yar ye scruvy bearded dwarf, just over tha hill there."  <br><br>

Ritap says, "Arrrrrrrrrrr!"  <br><br>

Captain Nalot says, "Hrm? Who is scuffin' around out here?"  <br><br>

Captain Nalot says, "Arrrrrr what is it ye want?"  <br><br>

General Bragmur says, "Well ya see sir, we have a surplus of Velium that we would not mind sharing with you for yer tinkerin' but would ask a favor in return for it."  <br><br>

Captain Nalot says, "Velium eh? Well there matey lets hear what you have got to say!"  <br><br>

Adisson Stubblechin says, "Arrr. Ahoy there, ya hull-faced, landlubbin', mast rats! Keep them beady eyes open! Remember, yer mean, nasty, pirates! Keep yer eyepatches square as a jig and yer rapiers sharp as a barnacle!"  <br><br>

General Bragmur says, "I represent the Dain in this matter, we would like for you to use yer Icebreaker there to head to Antonica and bring reinforcements for the war that is preparing to ensue. We are needin' all the help we can get against the Kromrif."   <br><br>
{Avatar of Below spawns.}   <br><br>
Avatar of Below's voice echoes through the area. "The efforts to help the Coldain and bring them together with the gnomes of Iceclad is quite impressive. There will be no doubt that they will continue to increase in power until they can overtake the Giants of Zek. Hey there, what is that on your shoulder?"  <br><br>

Give Avatar of Below: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (Approved)  <br><br>

Avatar of Below holds the shawl up close to one eye to look at the rune sewn into it. He smiles to himself and then drops it to the ground and places one hand on it. A bright blue glow starts to emanate in the snow, then there is a sudden flash! The Avatar has dissipated. All that is left behind is the Shawl lying in the snow, shimmering with a new power. Yournamehere slowly bends down to pick it up, and is infused with a blessing from Brell.  <br><br>

Receive: BLESSED COLDAIN PRAYER SHAWL  <br><br>
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP AC+8 Sta+8 Wis+8 Int+8 Cha+8 MR+8 FR+8 CR+8 PR+8 DR+8 HP+50 Mana+50 Weight: 2.0 ALL/ALL Lore, No Drop, Magic - Effects Flowing Thought III (3 mana/tick, permanent) and Focus effect: Zephyr of Brell (see below) <br><br>

CONGRATULATIONS!! <BR><br>

General Bragmur says, "I must go tell the Dain of these events immediately!"  <br><br>

Captain Nalot scratches his head, "Yar ya do that ya crazy Coldain."   <br><br>
========================  <br><br>
THINGS TO BE AWARE OF: <BR><BR>
========================  <br><br>
THE WARNING - Dealing with the Dratted Dain  <br><br>
In order to complete this quest you must meet with the Dain. He is a popular raid target because he drops some nice equipment and quest items. This means that he is very rarely to be found alive and well. Since we need him for the quest, the Coldain allow us to summon him once so that we don't have to spend ages hanging out waiting in Icewell and competing with raids when he does appear. The problem is that if you follow the quest instructions in order as they are given by the Coldain, you need the Dain twice and therefore have to wait around for him the second time anyway. That's government for you.   <br><br>
The way it works is that there are two versions of the Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl. The first is the "Original" one you create during the seventh shawl quest, while the second is the "Approved" one that you get back upon showing the first to any of the eighth shawl quest Coldain except for Loremaster Borannin. I have noted throughout the NPC text which version you can give to which Coldain (of those who ask for it) and which version they will give you back. You can tell the two versions apart by holding your shawl on your cursor and having someone cast the spell Identify on you (or cast it on yourself). If it identifies as "Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl", it is the Original version. If it identifies as "Approved by the Dain", it is the Approved version.   <br><br>
Therefore, the way to do the quest without losing your ability to spawn the Dain is thus:   <br>
Step 1: Talk to Loremaster Borannin if you did not already at the end of the seventh.  <br>
Step 2: Craft all of the pieces of Imbued Royal Velium Armor.  <br>
Step 3: Spawn the Dain if he is not already available and get the Royal Coldain Orders.  <br>
Step 4: Immediately run to Loremaster Solstrin and get the Issue Kit.  <br>
Step 5: Immediately combine the prepared armor in the Issue Kit.  <br>
Step 6: Immediately go give the Coldain Standard Issue Kit to the Dain.  <br>
Step 7: Whenever your raid force is ready, take the Approved Issue Kit to General Bragmur in Iceclad and complete the quest with the war and ending conversation with the Avatar of Brell.   <br><br>
Everyone except for Loremaster Borranin and Meg Tucter are in Icewell Keep. The Chamberlain and Dain are up top in the Dain's throne room. From the entrance to the fortress take the second hallway either on the right or left and go up the stairs. That puts you on the second floor, where you will find another set of stairs right next to those that will take you up another floor. The Chamberlain stands just to the left of the Dain's throne at about 685, 8. The Dain himself wanders between his throne or his bedroom, which is through the hidden passage through the curtains behind his throne. There is no danger to going back there as long as you are not KOS to either Coldain or Dain factions. Meg Tucter is out in Thurgadin itself. From the entrance to the Thurgadin town area, turn right and she's in the first shop on the left, the jewelery shop. Loremaster Solstrin can be found in the basement of Icewell Keep. From the front entrance to the fortress, go straight back and to the left around the ice tunnel coming down through the middle of the room. Go through the hallway in the back of the room and to the left and take the door on the left between the two Watchers. He is all the way down at the bottom at loc 782, 200.   <br><br>
DAIN FACTION: If you have gone completely through the first seven shawl quests doing all the work and receiving all of the faction hits yourself, and have never taken any additional positive or negative hits to Dain faction, you will be dubious to the Dain. That's okay, dubious will work just fine. If you're threatening or scowling, you can improve your Dain faction by getting hits off of the death of some prominent giants like King Tormax and his few closest buddies, or by completing certain quests. The hits from King Tormax are quite large while the hits from quests are relatively tiny...but are easier if you don't have access to a Tormax raid. You can try repeating the first and second shawls or the beginning of the Phenocryst Focus quest. There are numerous other possibilities, although they may be no more palatable.  <br><br>
========================  <br><br>
After the War
If you have failed the war you can still try again! However, you will need to make a new set of armor and you will not be able to summon the Dain. You can either endure a tedious camp for him to respawn, get chummy with guilds that target him and know when he'll return, or find someone starting the eighth shawl for the first time and do your turn-in when they do. He does not despawn when he sends you to the General, so he'll stick around for you when the other person is done. (Yes, when triggered he is a normal Dain spawn and has his usual loot so when spawned he can still be valuable to a raid. But if you ask me it's still pretty despicable to summon him to complete the most sacred quest of his people and then turn him over to be killed!)  If you have successfully defended the General and reach the gnome camp, you should receive your shawl as indicated in the NPC text. The Avatar of Brell is not on Dain or Coldain faction and appears to be indifferent to all. <br><br>
========================  <br><br>
The Shawl's Effects <br> <br>

It has not one but two effects: Flowing Thought III and Zephyr of Brell. Flowing Thought is found on many items in Norrath in strengths ranging from I through V. In this case it adds a constant additional mana regen of 3 points of mana per tick. Flowing Thought items all stack with each other, to a maximum total of 15 points of Flowing Thought at any given time. Zephyr of Brell, however, is unique to the shawl. It is a special 20% extended duration IV focus effect. It will extend the usual duration of any beneficial buffs of any level by 20%. This makes the shawl especially precious to those of us who cast a lot of buffs, as most other extended duration focus effects in Norrath are 15% or less. Like all focus effects on items, it stacks with the AA abilities that extend buff duration but does not stack with other extended duration focus effects. <br><br>
Focus Effect: Zephyr of Brell <br>
1: Increase Spell Duration by 20% <br>
2: Limit: Max Level(65) <br>
3: Limit: Spell Type(Beneficial only) <br>
4: Limit: Effect(Complete Heal (with duration) excluded) <br>
5: Limit: Effect(Invunerability excluded) <br>
6: Limit: Min Duration(48.00 sec) <br><br>
