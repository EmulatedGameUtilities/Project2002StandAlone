========================  <br><br>

When you finish the second shawl quest, LOREMASTER BORANNIN tells you about this one. He is found in the Temple of Lore at -320, 720. To get there, after you enter Thurgadin and come in to the town area, turn left. When the path forks to the right, continue going straight down the ramp. The building all the way at the back of that area is the Temple of Lore, and Borannin is inside on the stage.  <br><br>

After receiving your Cloth Coldain Shawl, ask Loremaster Borannin "What chore?" <br><br>

Loremaster Borannin says 'The council agrees that you have demonstrated a disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask that you demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving our people. Give this, my seal, to Mordin. He will instruct you further." <br><br>

Receive: BORANNIN'S SEAL  <br><br>

Go to MORDIN FROSTCLEAVER in Mordin's Meats at -220, -231. To get there when you enter Thurgadin and reach the main town area, turn right. After the first bend to the left, his shop will be close by on the left.  <br><br>

You say, "Hail Mordin Frostcleaver" <br><br>

Mordin Frostcleaver says "Ah, hello there, and welcome to me shop, Barbarian. Ye'll have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here lately. . . HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a selection of some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious. In addition to supplyin' the freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to would-be hunters in the wastes." <br><br>

Give Mordin: BORANNIN'S SEAL  <br><br>

Mordin Frostcleaver says "Hullo Yournamehere, I see you've signed on for a bit of food service eh? Well we can always use an extra pair a hands here dat's fer sure. First things first, warsh yer grubby mitts an cook up dinner fer good ol Leif. Shouldn be too tough fer ye, he has simple enough taste. Make him a TUNDRABEAR SANDWICH an lemme know when he's been fed. Dontcha ferget ta give him this with his meal."  <br><br>

Receive: LEIF'S NAPKIN   <br><br>

You say, "What is a Tundrabear Sandwich?"  <br><br>

Mordin Frostcleaver says "Dat's easy, ye just take a slab a dat TUNDRA KODIAK MEAT and a JUG A SAUCE, put it in da oven, den combine the product with a LOAF A BREAD in a mixin bowl an there ye be."  <br><br>

Combine in Oven: 1 TUNDRA KODIAK MEAT + 1 JUG OF SAUCES = Saucybear Meat. (trivial 51) 
Combine in Mixing Bowl: SAUCYBEAR MEAT + 1 LOAF OF BREAD = Tundrabear Sandwich. (trivial <51) 

Tundra Kodiak Meat drops off of Tundra Kodiaks in East Wastes. It does not drop every time but both the kodiaks and their meat are common enough that this shouldn't be too painful. 

Take the sandwich to Guard Leif, who is at -281, 500 outside the Paladin Guild. The guild is located just before the Temple of Lore, on the right, by the creepy statue with the glowing red eyes. Leif stands on guard just to the right of the entrance to the guild. Be careful not to be confused by Leifur, a completely different coldain that hangs out in the basement of a building and gives the bard armor quests. Give Guard Leif the tundrabear sandwich and his napkin, and he will give you back his Used Napkin. <br><br>

Give Guard Leif: TUNDRABEAR SANDWICH & LEIF'S NAPKIN   <br><br>

Guard Leif says "Well I'll be derned. An outlander that can make a good Bearmeat 'n Bread! Thank ye Yournamehere."  <br><br>

Receive: USED NAPKIN  <br><br>

Return the napkin to Mordin and he'll give you "TRITA'S NAPKIN".  <br><br>

Mordin Frostcleaver says "Well done outlander! We'll make a chef of you before we're through. Next you'll need to whip up some Snow Bunny stew fer missus Coldheart. Again, give her this napkin with her meal an lemme know when she's been served."  <br><br>

Receive: TRITA'S NAPKIN   <br><br>

You say, "What is  SNOW BUNNY STEW?"  <br><br>

Mordin Frostcleaver says "Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa BUNNY MEAT and a JUG A SAUCES. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks a water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty!"  <br><br>

Combine in Mixing Bowl: 2 BUNNY MEAT + 1 JUG OF SAUCES = Saucy Bunnymeat. (trivial <63)  <br>
Combine in Oven: SAUCY BUNNYMEAT + SPICES + 2 FLASKS OF WATER + POT = Snow Bunny Stew. (trivial 103)  <br><br>

SNOW BUNNIES are all over East Wastes and drop the meat often enough, but they can be hard to see on the white snow. When doing the second combine, make sure that the two flasks of water are not stacked.  <br><br>

Take the stew to TRITA COLDHEART, who is downstairs in the house at -110, 270. To get there from the entrance to town, turn left and go past the bank. Follow the path when it bends around to the right, and Trita's house is the first one on the left.  <br><br>

Give Trita: SNOW BUNNY STEW & TRITA'S NAPKIN   <br><br>

Trita Coldheart says "Why thank you Yournamehere, I haven't tasted snow bunny stew this good in quite some time. Be a dear and take this back to Mordin for me."  <br><br>

Receive: DIRTY POT   <br><br>

Take the pot to Mordin and he will give you "BRITA'S NAPKIN".  <br><br>

Mordin Frostcleaver says "Now yer cookin! Letsee here... Guard Leif, check... Trita Coldheart, check... Ahh yes, next we need an Ulthork meat pie fer Brita. She's a doll, smart too, but she can be testy when she's hungry so get movin!"  <br><br>

Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br> 
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse  <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse  <br>
You gain experience!! <br><br>

Receive: BRITA'S NAPKIN   <br><br>

You say, "What is ULTHORK MEAT PIE?"  <br><br>

Mordin Frostcleaver says "Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been awhile since I made one. Here we are, two ULTHORK MEATS, a VINEGAR and a SPICES in a mixin bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump a dough, an a pie tin in da oven an yer good ta go."  <br><br>

Combine in Mixing Bowl: 2 ULTHORK MEAT + 1 VINEGAR + 1 SPICES = Spicy Ulthork Meat. (trivial 82) <br>
Combine in Mixing Bowl: 1 EGG usable for dough + 1 MILK + 1 CUP OF FLOUR = Clump of Dough. (trivial 17) <br>
Combine in Oven: SPICY ULTHORK MEAT + 1 CLUMP OF DOUGH + PIE TIN = Ulthork Meat Pie. (trivial 89-95) <br><br>

Ulthorks and their meat are common enough. The meat is edible when you loot it, so be careful not to gobble it up before you get around to baking it. When making the SPICY ULTHORK MEAT you must put the two ulthork meats in separate slots, do not stack them. Many different kinds of eggs can be used to make clumps of dough, but don't use your griffon eggs for it! You will probably find it easiest to leave Velious to get an egg that will work. <br><br>

Take the meat pie to LOREKEEPER BRITA, who is at -180, 810 in the Temple of Lore. When you enter the Temple, turn right into the library and she is in the aisle all the way on the left.  <br><br>

Give Lorekeeper Brita: ULTHORK MEAT PIE & BRITA'S NAPKIN   <br><br>

Lorekeeper Brita says "Ohh, that's better. I get so touchy when I'm hungry. I should probably go apologize to Derrin for being snappy. Please return this to Mordin for me."  <br><br>

Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse  <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse  <br>
You gain experience!! <br><br>

Receive: DIRTY PIE TIN   <br><br>

Return the pie tin to Mordin and he gives you "THORIDAIN'S NAPKIN". <br><br>

Mordin Frostcleaver says "More dirty dishes eh? Well outlander, only one more meal to serve and I'll be done with ye. Make a Snow Griffin souffle fer the Grand Historian himself. It's his favorite."  <br><br>

Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br> 
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse  <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse  <br>
You gain experience!! <br><br>

Receive: THORIDAIN'S NAPKIN   <br><br>

You say, "What is SNOW GRIFFIN SOUFFLE?"  <br><br>

Mordin Frostcleaver says "This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four SNOW GRIFFIN EGGS and a PACK OF SPICES in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's all gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it TO THORIDAIN and if ye did it right he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl and he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen." <br> <br>

Combine in Oven: 4 SNOW GRIFFIN EGGS + 1 SPICES = SNOW GRIFFIN SOUFFLE. (trivial 118-127) <br><br>

SNOW GRIFFS and their eggs are a great big pain in the patoot to find. They are rare to begin with, and can be extremely rare because of folks after them for this quest. They are No Drop, so you cannot buy them or have someone else collect em. I suggest focusing generally in the areas around and between the bridge, orc fort, and Kerafyrm's Lair entrance, as these three places tend to have higher frequencies of griff sightings.  I'd say maybe one in every three or four griffs drops an egg. If you are without tracker or aren't finding any griffins at all, try randomly killing other animals in the area to see if you can get griffs to spawn. The souffle is trivial at less than 127, but this is definitely harder than the previous recipes. Make sure that you do not stack the eggs in the oven, they must be in separate spaces in order to successfully combine. "Griffon eggs" drop or are foraged in other zones, but the only ones that work for this quest drop from the snow griffs in East Wastes. <br><br>

Take the SOUFFLE to GRAND HISTORIAN THORIDAIN who is right next to our old friend Borannin on the stage in the Temple of Lore. Give him the SOUFFLE and THORIDAIN'S NAPKIN and he'll give you "SEAL OF THORIDAIN". <br> <br>

Grand Historian Thoridain says "My compliments, Yournamehere, what a wonderful dish! Please accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May it give you power over your adversaries." <br> <br>

Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br> 
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse  <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse  <br>
You gain experience!! <br><br>

Receive: Seal of Thoridain  <br> <br>

Give the  SEAL OF THORIDAIN along with your CLOTH COLDAIN PRAYER SHAWL to LOREMASTER BORANNIN, and he returns the very same Seal to you to keep, as well as your WOVEN COLDAIN PRAYER SHAWL. Two prizes, whoo hoo! <br><br>

Loremaster Borannin says "Well done Yournamehere, the council will be impressed with your effort. Here is the WOVEN PRAYER SHAWL, wear it with pride. I know there is talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask me what the council has brewing."  <br><br>

Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br> 
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse  <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse  <br>
You gain experience!! <br><br>
