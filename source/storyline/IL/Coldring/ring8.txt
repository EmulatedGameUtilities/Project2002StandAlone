=====================
<br>
This is the 8th Garadain quest. It is an all out war against Chief Ry'Gorr and his troops.<br> 
<br>
Garadain says 'Very Well, Kaladur , give me the Adamantite ring and I will give you the marching orders. Once the orders are given to Gloradin in the next hut, we will be underway. You then must follow me to what will be our battleground. I must warn you, I will hold your ring until the head of Chief Ry'Gorr is given to me. If we fail, all will be lost... for both of us.<br> 
<br>
As you can see, the 8th quest is tough. You only get ONE chance to do it right. Once you give Garadain your ring, you must kill Chief Ry'Gorr, loot his head, and give the head to Garadain. Ry'gorr only has a head during this event. I am unsure if you can do the quest if Garadain dies. Most likely, if he dies during this event you won't be able to complete the quest. You only get one shot at this, because you lose the ring.<br> 
<br>
This battle involves 30+ rygorr, including some low 50's. This probably requires a well-tuned team of 55-60th level snare kiters, or alternatively a full 30+ PC army.<br>
