This is the 5th Garadain Quest. Garadain asks you to go intercept a rygorr messenger who is carrying invasion plans. Garadain instructs you to give the invasion plans to a coldain lookout in his camp. He also tells you to intercept the invasion force and kill the leader, an orc named Scarbrow. When you give the lookout the plans, a veritable horde 
of orcs attacks Garadain's outpost. Scarbrow leads a force of 2-3 rygorr invaders (lvl 42-44) and 2-3 rygorr oracles. (lvl 42-44)<br> 
<br>
Without your assistance the orcs will probably wipe out the dwarves, however this isn't good because the dwarves can outdamage you, and thus cause Scarbrow's corpse to poof when you do finally kill him.<br>
<br>
The trick is this: The orcs spawn about 100 yards from the camp. You must intercept Scarbrow before the dwarves agro. You can let the dwarves kill the other invaders, and I highly suggest it, because 7 43+ mobs are a pain. Scarbrow himself is about 47th level and is a shadow knight. Anyway, get Scarbrow away from the action and kill him there while one person kites the other orcs. There is some risk here in that the oracles may sow themselves and they can do some real damage with spells if you try to kite them. But doing it this way only required 3 people, whereas killing all 7 toe-to-toe would probably require 2 groups, even if you had an enchanter.<br> 
<br>
Scarbrow dropa his head and a Frozen Orb, a very nice range slot item. Giving his head and your platinum ring to Garadain results in the Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring.<br>
