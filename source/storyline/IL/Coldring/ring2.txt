=====================
<br>
You must first do the Garadain's Blanket quest to get your copper ring.<br>
<br>
After that, Garadain asks you to take the axe he gives you to his nephew Boridain, and bring back proof that he is ok, along with your Copper ring. This requires going to coordinates -2446, 1544 and giving Boridain the Axe.<br>
<br>
At this point, he will start trying to find his Rabid Kodiak. Which means he wanders around and gets in trouble. You must keep him from dying. I highly suggest a minimum of two people for this, so one can fight and the other can keep following Boridain. Some of the mobs we had to fight were blue to a 52, btw. Eventually, a Rabid Kodiak will spawn. Kill it, loot the rabid pelt, and give to Boridain. You don't have much time, as he will despawn in a minute or two after the kodiak is dead. He will give you back a Broken Axe. Take this Broken Axe (this is your "proof" for Garadain) and your Copper ring back to Garadain to recieve a Silver ring.<br>
<br> 
There was xp but no faction for completing this quest.<br>
