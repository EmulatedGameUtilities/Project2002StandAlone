=====================
<br>
Hand Seneschal Aldikar the 8th Coldain Ring (Velium Coldain Insigna Ring)after a short dialogue he will say 'Will you accept this task outlander?<br> 
<br>
You say, 'I will accept the task'<br> 
<br>
He will hand you a 6 Slot container and ask you to put Rodrick's Dagger and the heads of the Traitors.<br> 
<br>
We need 6 items<br> 
<br>
1) Rodrick's Dagger (Eastern Wastes)<br> 
2) Murdrick's Head (Great Divide)<br> 
3) Berradin's Head (Eastern Wastes)<br> 
4) Peffin's Head (Eastern Wastes)<br> 
5) Doldigun's Head (Kael)<br> 
6) Juliash's Head (Icewell Keep)<br> 
<br>
1) Dagger. Kill Rodrick in EW loot dagger. (See 6th Coldain Ring quest for details)<br> 
<br>
2) Murdrick's Head. Kill Murdrick in GD. When he is aggrod all the mobs rush too him. Pass up his room, there is another room deeper in on the right. Set up camp there. Harmony the room. Have a lvl 60 pull him from max range and pull in to the group, he will not depop in there. If you have any adds have someone aggro them and pull them out of the cave. Make sure Davin Fatfist returns to his spawn spot or Murdrick will not spawn. Loot Head and recipe for tainted avalanche ale.<br> 
<br>
3) Berradin's head. Make Tainted Avalanche Ale. Hand to Captain Berradin in EW, Kill him after he falls down. His bodyguards WILL help him. Harmony pull works best. Loot Head and Note to Peffin, Tainted Avalanche Ale Recipe, Combine: Bottle, An iceball, an Ice Wyvren Stinger, Artic Mussels, Seahorse Scales, a Runed Seashell (Cloud), and a vial of Mind Melt. Trivial confirmed at 248.<br> 
<br>
4) Peffin's Head. Hand Note to Peffin, in Giant fort, in EW, She is invisable. She will respawn and run out, she is very glitchy you may not see her, just dont attack until she respawns a second time in front of the fire. 3 Giants spawn inside the hut, they see invis, are 51+, harmony, CoH, or gate to get out. Peffin will be standing right in front of the fire at the bottom of the hill. She has 5 Giant guards 51+ and all are rooted, you can no longer pull her or her guards. Kill Peffin and loot her head and a note to Doldigun.<br> 
<br>
5) Doldigun's Head at Loc neg 850, pos 1150. Doldigun can be found in Kael. He can be spawned by saying "the Dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain" Hand him the note and he hands you a Juliash Lockhearts Ring.<br> 
<br>
If you attack him he runs and 2 guards show up. Several Giants will spawn, I think at most 2 at a time. Keep killing these giants until Doldigun respawns. Once he does kill him and loot the head.<br> 
<br>
*** He does not seem to spawn if the giants are up **<br> 
<br>
6) Juliash's Head. Hand Juliash her ring. She will respawn and hits for 350's the other Dwarfs do not aggro. Kill her and loot head, she also has a chance of dropping a necklace, and spells. If friends KoS fight in the theater at 9am when court starts she is last too leave.<br> 
<br>
Combine the heads in the box with Rodrick's dagger. Then hand the Box and the 8th ring (Velium Coldain Insigna Ring) to the Dain in Icewell Keep.<br>
