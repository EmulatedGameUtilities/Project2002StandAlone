=====================
<br>
This is the third quest in the Garadain series. This time, he wants you to make him a nice knife. You need a flawless walrus hide, a wooly rhino tusk, and a skinning rock. The walrus hide is actually a high quality walrus hide, and the tusk is a horn. These can be found on the appropriate mobs. The hard part is the skinning rock, which spawns randomly on the ground. Once you have all three items, combine them in a forge to make Garadain's new knife. (Trivial at 65) Once you have the knife made, take it and your Silver ring back to Garadain for the gold ring. He then gives you the quest for the platinum ring, the details of which are still unclear.<br>
