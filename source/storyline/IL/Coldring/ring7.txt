=====================
<br>
This is the 7th Garadain Quest.<br> 
<br>
Garadain asks you to rescue Corbin Blackwell. Kill Warden Bruke for his Shackle Key (no drop) and then give both the key and your mithril insignia ring to Corbin Blackwell. He will make his escape. (And give back the ring). You must protect Corbin until he reaches Dobbin Crossaxe.<br> 
<br>
Along the way 4 rygorr and 4 giants including Commander Bahreck, a named giant, will attack Corbin. You must keep him alive. Once he reaches Dobbin, Dobbin will thank you for rescuing him and tell you that he will give you a note for Garadain if you show him your mithril insignia ring.<br> 
<br>
Giving Dobbin the ring results in a note. Give this note back to Garadain and he will reward you with the adamantium ring and the final quest.<br>
