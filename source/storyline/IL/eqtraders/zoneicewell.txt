<br><br>
These merchants are underneath the main keep. Note that the area under the keep has quite a few 50+ mobs in it, and we've yet to find a path to these merchants that does NOT involve fighting your way through to them. Also be aware that once you do get to them, there's a side-path that leads away from them that appears to end in a pit. Stepping through there will send you through a 1-way zone and dump you into the tizmak caves in the Great Divide.
