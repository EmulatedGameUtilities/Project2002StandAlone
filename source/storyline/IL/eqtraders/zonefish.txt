**There are two fishable spots in all of Dulak. One is located in a bar, where you can fish through a hole in the ground, but you will be surrounded by a lot of agro mobs. If you stand between the wall and the fishing hole, you should be able to avoid agro. The second one is at 2252, -821. Invis up after you zone in from Gunthak, turn left at the first corner, and instead of following the wall around, head straight ahead into the wall to find a hidden tunnel. Run down the tunnel (nothing seems to see invis along the way, thankfully), over a bridge and other fun stuff. If you have an option to turn right or go straight, go straight. Eventually you'll come to a waterfall, that will lead down to a rectangular pool. You'll find a safe spot with your back to the wall that will allow you to fish in relative safety even once invis drops. Just watch the mob placement carefully to find the right spot.

^^Torgiran mines: Deep in the zone there is a trap floor that leads to underwater area. You can fish at the area where you get out of the water. Another spot is mentioned as being around 1585, -455. Take your first left in the zone, then go down the stairs to find access to the water tunnels. Great care should be used when fishing in this zone, as we've yet to find an area that does not have quite a few mobs nearby.
