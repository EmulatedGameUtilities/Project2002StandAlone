Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt 
<br><br>
The quest starts in Lake Rathe where you must retrieve the Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt. It spawns underneath the three aviak spawn tower. If you go straight down underwater and swim to the bottom, you will find the hilt lying there. You don't need enduring breath if you know where the hilt is but it might be safer with it. 
<br><br>
Next you need one diamond, one black sapphire, and one jacinth. These drop in the planes, high level dungeons such as Karnor's Castle and Sebilis, and can be bought for high prices in trading zones such as Greater Faydark. 
<br><br>
Take the items to Wenden Blackhammer, a level 50 Dwarf in East Freeport. He will give you back the Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt. 
<br><br>
Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt 
<br><br>
Next, retrieve the Damaged Dragon Head Hilt from the Chessboard in Timorous Deep. The location is -6500, +3000. It spawns at the base of the King Piece. Get a druid to come with you so that they can cast SoW and Levitate. This way you won't have to swim the entire way or loose levitate half way there and have to swim the rest of the way. Evil classes be warned, there is a high elf wizard that roams the area. He is KoS to evil classes, and will blast you apart if you get too near him. 
<br><br>
Next, get a Giant Sized Monocle from a Mountain Giant Patriarch in the Dreadlands (rare drop). This is a level 47 mountain giant that spawns around the giant fortress. One way to get it to spawn is to kill absolutely everything in the fortress. This can be done easily by a level 55+ warrior with a 35-60 level druid/cleric for heals and regeneration. After everything is killed wait for it to spawn again and then kill them. Continue doing this until the Patriarch spawns. The Patriarch cannot be soloed. You will need one full group of level 47-52. With a full group, he is very easy. These Giants has tons of hit points so be careful when killing them. 
<br><br>
Take the Monocle to Mentrax Mountainbone in Frontier Mountains. He is at the giant fortress at the very end of the mine. You might have to do a little bit of fighting to get there. Mentrax will give you in return for the Monocle, Rejesiam Ore. 
<br><br>
Next, head to the Plane of Fear. You must loot the Ball of Everliving Golem from either Fright, Terror, or Dread. These are all level 50-52 named golems and personal guards of Cazic-Thule. They spawn at the temple. Take the Hilt, Ore, and Ball back to Wenden Blackhammer and he will give you the Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt. 
<br><br>
Ancient Sword Blade 
<br><br>
Now, go to The Freeport Authority and purchase a Keg of Vox Tail Ale. This will cost only 150-200 platinum depending on your charisma. 
<br><br>
Now go to Permafrost and kill An Ice Giant. Note: You must kill the Ice Giants in Permafrost. These are level 38-42 and put up for a very hard fight. They hit for over 100 damage rapidly and have tons of hitpoints. A major pain in the butt. Sometimes they will drop A Block of Permafrost. This is one of the items you need. 
<br><br>
While you are in Permafrost waiting for one to spawn, kill some goblin wizards and loot the Heart of Frost. You will need it later in the quest.
<br><br>
Now, if you have high tinkering skill, create two Rebreathers. If you don't have high tinkering skill, then you can purchase these from players in your trading zone. They go for around 2-3k a piece. Turn in the items to Denken Strongpick. He can be found on the aviak island in Ocean of Tears. He will give you the Ancient Sword Blade. 
<br><br>
Ancient Blade 
<br><br>
The Ancient Blade is dropped by the Queen of Chardok, Queen Velazul. She takes an Uber Guild to kill because she is level 62. She has many followers around her including sorcerers and healers. She is a shaman so she has been AE spells such as high damage spells and poison AE's. 
<br><br>
The Red Scabbard 
<br><br>
Go to East Freeport and find Kargek Redblade. 
<br><br>
Hail him and say I will do you a favor. He gives you a wax sealed note.
<br><br>
Take this note to Oknoggin Stonesmasher, a named ogre in Feerrott. He can be found standing next to the stone bridge. He will give you a Tiny Lute in return for the note. Take the Lute back to Kargek in exchange for a Book. 
<br><br>
Take the book to Tenal Redblade in East Karanas. He is at the very end of the canyon next to the ramp to Highpass. This is a very long canyon and you will past many NPCs here. Tenal is the very last one. Tenal will give you a Frozen War Totem. Give him the Frozen War Totem and the Heart of Frost (that you looted while hunting Ice Giants). He will give you the Totem of Fiery War.
<br><br>
Now you need a Red Scale. This is most commonly dropped by Lord Nagafen, a level 55 dragon in Nagafen's Lair but can also be found off of Zordakilicus Ragefire in or Talendor in Skyfire.
<br><br>
There is also a mob in The Hole named Nortlav the Scalekeeper. He is a level 51-55 Erudite that drops the Red Dragon Scale for the Warrior Epic. He hits for about 190 on average. He has a nasty harmtouch that does around 1500 damage. Besides this he also has a high magic resist. Wizard spells Ice Comet and the Lure Line will stick. Necromancer DoTs will also work. 
<br><br>
Now find the Green Scale from Severilous, a level 60 Sarnak dragon in Emerald Jungle. This mean dragon slashes for 500 and has a wolf pet to help him. You need many groups to kill this monster. 
<br><br>
Hoshkar in Veeshan's Peak will also drop Green Scales for the Epic Quest. This dragon is level 65 dragon that can only be killed by quite powerful guilds. 
<br><br>
Take the red scale, the green scale, and the Totem of Fiery War and give them to Tenal. Tenal will give you the Mark of the Sword. 
<br><br>
Now go to The Plane of Hate and kill the level 53 Follower of Innoruuk, Maestro of Rancor. He can be found sitting at his piano. Be careful with this guy because he has a 200 hp AOE lifetap spell. Once he has been killed, a small hand which looks like a frightfinger, will spawn at Maestro's Piano. When killing it, you will need to keep it rooted because it runs very fast when low of health. After you kill this hand, another hand will spawn which is called Hand of the Maestro. This hits hard and has a ton of hp so be prepared for a fairly hard fight.
<br><br>
Loot the Hand of Maestro from him. Turn in the Hand and the Mark of the Sword to Tenal for a message to Kargek. 
<br><br>
Now go to The Plane of Air and kill The Spiroc Lord. This is one of the hardest creatures in Plane of Air. It is level 63 and looks like a rainbow aviak.  Retrieve from his corpse a Spiroc Wingblade. 
<br><br>
Take the note and the Spiroc Winglblade to Kargek. He will reward you with the Red Scabbard. 
<br><br>
Fashioning the Blades
<br><br>
You then take the Blades and the Hilts and you combine them in The Red Scabbard.
<br><br>
You then will come out with two 1 handed weapons. You can use these weapons if you are specialized in 1 hand or you can combine those two 1 hand weapons in the scabbard again and get one two handed weapon.
