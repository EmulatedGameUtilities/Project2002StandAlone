<c "#00CC00"> SECTION 2: GREATER FAYDARK HATE QUESTS </C>

The following quests are completed in Greater Faydark. Seana Marsinger is located just north of the wizard spires. When you hail her, this dialogue follows:  <br><br>

You say, 'Hail, Seana Marsinger' <br><br>

Seana Marsinger says 'Hello, my name is Seana Marsinger. I am here representing my loyalty to the League of Antonican Bards. It matters not to me whether you support the League or loathe it propaganda is not my objective. Everyone must find their own truths in this life path, so says Quellious. To business then, are you [familiar with the Plane of Hate?]' <br><br>

You say, 'I am familiar with the Plane of Hate' <br><br>

Seana Marsinger says 'Good, I need someone that has a bit of an eye for how things should look up there. My brother and I have been studying Innoruuk and his intricate dealings for years. Being raised in New Tanaan may lend us certain neutrality towards all people, yet the values our parents have instilled in us do not allow us to let him go unwatched. In fact, I have begun to believe that my paranoia may prove useful not only to the League, but to the Citizens of Tranquility and New Tanaan itself as well. We have received a simple [piece of intelligence] that may conceivably upset the entire balance of the Pantheon and have most dire repercussions here in Norrath.' <br><br>

You say, 'what piece of intelligence' <br><br>

Seana Marsinger says 'An old friend of our father's in Qeynos, Jusean Evanesque, has been very busy sorting out the information that is coming to him in droves.  The first clue came from Kardin Nillic in Gunthak, and then in bits and pieces from many travelers moving through Qeynos. Piracy on the seas has grown, and somehow the Broken Skull Clan has gained power that should have been out of their grasp. Our informants there say that it can only come from Innoruuk. I am afraid that the Plane itself has shifted with this power. I do not believe that we will be able to uncover all that we need [alone] in time to warn people of the dangers.' <br><br>

You say, 'why are you alone' <br><br>

Seana Marsinger says 'Our parents are back in Qeynos assisting Jusean with all that needs to be verified and ensuring that the League's network contacts are all still viable. They will need to stay there in case we must get the word out quickly. I do not believe that any of the residents of Tanaan would approve of our little quest, and would view it as biased. Thus we are here alone. Does this type of project [interest] you?' <br><br>

You say, 'I am interested' <br><br><br>

At this point, depending on what variety of class you are (INT caster, priest, hybrid, or pure melee), Stefan will then "size you up" and give you your class-appropriate quest, telling you which type of mobs you need to hunt in Hate. The quests consist of three parts, related to the three sections of the zone: north (lowest level), middle/cathedral area (midlevel), south/Innoruuk's stronghold (highest level).   <br><br>

Even if you are still working on the first level of this quest, if you kill a mid-ranged or high level mob of the same line (lich, ghast, etc), you can determine whether a drop will be something you need, because the mob/class lines do not change. <br><br>

===================== <br><br>

IF YOU ARE A <c "#00CC00"> HYBRID </C> SHE ASKS:  <br><br>

Stefan Marsinger takes a moment to size you up. 'You appear to study both magic and might, am I correct?' <br><br>

You say, 'Yes' <br><br>

Stefan Marsinger says 'I believe it is safest if you study those who have similar interests as yourself. Travel to the Plane of Hate and observe the GHASTS, SCORN BANSHEES, and HAUNTED CHESTS. They seem to share some qualities of your art and lie in the least dangerous areas. My interaction with these creatures has been mostly at a distance, and I am not as familiar with them as I would like. If you survive long enough to uncover some sort of MINOR SIGNET that verifies you have been studying these creatures, and truly wish to aid with this cause, bring it to me along with some ABHORRENT POWDER and a JACINTH. I can craft you protective item and may have some further work for you to do.' <br><br>

Once you hand her the signet, abhorrent powder and jacinth, you receive the GEM OF COURAGE. <br><br>

GEM OF COURAGE: Slot - range, lore/magic/nodrop, RNG PAL BST BRD SHD, race all - AC10 STR5 STA5 WIS5 INT5 CHAT5 MR5 FR5 CR5 HP35 Mana35, wt 0.0 size small <br><br>

You say, 'what work?'  <br><br>

Stefan Marsinger says 'Wonderful. Return to the plane and continue your studies of the hybrid demons. With the new information you have brought I believe we have a good framework of reference for the lower rankings of these beings, however there is a higher echelon of power that I will need to be familiar with. Seek out the Tier'Dal KNIGHTS and GRAVE LORDS OF HATE. All of these creatures should be within your area of study, but take care! Make sure to keep your protection with you at all times. Some of them should have a kind of KNIGHT'S CREST symbolizing their rank; bring me this crest and some GHAST FINGERBONES, along with your GEM OF COURAGE. If you succeed in this task you are more valuable than I could have imagined, and I may need your skill with a final reconnaissance errand.' <br><br>

Turn in Knight's Crest, Ghast Fingerbones, Gem of Courage, and receive the GEM OF DARING. <BR><BR>

GEM OF DARING: Slot - range, lore/magic/nodrop, RNG PAL BST BRD SHD, race all - AC10 STR5 STA10 WIS5 INT5 CHAT5 SvM5 SvF5 SvC5 HP50 Mana50, wt 0.0 size small  <br><br>

You say 'What final task?' <br><br>

Stefan Marsinger says 'In my personal studies I have heard rumor that there are four archaic tomes that contain some of Innoruuk's darkest secrets. I cannot ask you to uncover all four, I am not even certain that they exist. The fabled tomes are the COMPENDIUM OF CLASSIC TORTURE, Texts on Pain, Writ of Agony, and Tactical Hatred. If they do indeed exist and you manage to find them, you are far grander than I. The tome that I do seek will most likely lie in the hands of one of Innoruuk's own confidantes, and they seldom seem to show their faces. It is possible the Prince of Hate himself holds the tomes close. Find me the Compendium of Classic Torture; return it to me with your Gem of Courage and your work is finished.'  <br><br>

Turn in Compendium of Classic Torture and Gem of Daring and receive the GEM OF HEROISM <BR><BR>

GEM OF HEROISM - range, lore/magic/nodrop, RNG PAL BST BRD SHD, race all -  AC15 STR10 STA15 WIS5 INT5 SvM15 SvF5 SvC5 SvP5 SvD5 HP75 Mana75, range slot, weight 0.0, permanent effect Vengence III (+15 ATK) <br><br>

===================== <br><br>

IF YOU ARE A <c "#00CC00"> PRIEST CLASS </C> SHE ASKS:  <br><br>

Stefan Marsinger takes a moment to size you up. 'You appear to be a priest of some sort, am I correct?' <br><br>

You say, 'Yes' <br><br>

Stefan Marsinger says 'I believe it is safest if you study those who have similar interests as yourself. Travel to the Plane of Hate and observe the CLERICS OF HATE and the SPITE GOLEMS. They seem to be the main practitioners of your art in the least dangerous area. My interaction with these creatures has been mostly at a distance, and I am not as familiar with them as I would like. If you survive long enough to uncover SOME TYPE OF SIGNET that proves you have been studying these creatures, and truly wish to aid with this cause, bring it to me along with some VAMPIRE DUST and a DIAMOND. I can craft you protective item and may have some further work for you to do.' <br><br>

Once you hand her the signet, the vampire dust and a diamond, you receive the GEM OF FAITH. <br><br>

GEM OF FAITH: magic/lore/nodrop, CLR DRU SHM, race all, AC10, STA5, WIS10, HP35, Mana35, SvF5, SvC5, SvM5, slot - range wt 0.0, size small,  <br><br>

Stefan Marsinger says 'Wonderful. Return to the plane and continue your studies of the priestly demons. With the new information you have brought I believe we have a good framework of reference for the lower rankings of these beings, however there is another echelon of power that I will need to be familiar with. Seek out the VENGENCE GOLEMS, and the higher priests of hate, the VICARS, TEMPLARS, and HIGH PRIESTS. All of these creatures should be within your area of study, but take care! You may even find some that follow your particular discipline if that makes you more comfortable. Make sure to keep your protection with you at all times. Some of them should have a kind of CREST symbolizing their rank; bring me this crest and some VENGENCE DUST from the GOLEMS, along with your GEM OF FAITH.  If you succeed in this task you are more valuable than I could have imagined, and I may need your skill with a final reconnaissance errand.'  <br><br>

Bring her these three items; this results in the GEM OF PIETY.  <br><br>

GEM OF PIETY - magic/lore/nodrop, CLR DRU SHM, race all, AC10 STA5 WIS10 HP50 Mana50, SvF5, SvC5, SvM5, slot - range wt 0.0, size small (need to confirm stats)  <br><br>

You say, 'What final task?' <br><br>

Seana Marsinger says 'In my personal studies I have heard rumor that there are four archaic tomes that contain some of Innoruuk's darkest secrets. I cannot ask you to uncover all four, I am not even certain that they exist. The fabled writings are the TOME OF DARK HEALING, Teachings of Innoruuk, Book of the Dead, and Applications of Suffering. If they do indeed exist and you manage to find them, you are far grander than I. The tome that I do seek will most likely lie in the hands of one of Innoruuk's own priests, and they seldom seem to leave their studies. It is possible the Prince of Hate himself holds the tomes close. Find me the TOME OF DARK HEALING; return it to me with your Gem of Piety and your work is finished.'  <br><br>

Turn in Tome of Dark Healing and Gem of Piety.

Travel to the Plane of Hate and observe the REVENANT, the ASHENBONE DRAKE, and the LOATHING LICH. They seem to be the main practitioners of your art in the least dangerous area.
