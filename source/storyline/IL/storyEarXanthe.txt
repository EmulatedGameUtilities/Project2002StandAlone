<br>Earring of Xanthe quest is also known as the POTC Earring, Nine Gifts, and Earring Nature/Solstice quest.
<br>This quest requires you to make (or buy from opther players) 9 gifts that you then combine into one large gift. You can do the quest for the Earring of the Solstice and then do it again for Xanthe's Earring of Nature (Druid Only).

<br>
<br>Before you start this quest be aware that the tradeskill trivials on some of the items listed below are very high. If you are just starting out with tradeskills please do not try this quest.
<br>You say, 'Hail, Rebecca Cabbageleaf'
<br>Rebecca Cabbageleaf seems lost in thought and looks up only briefly from her work. ''Oh, hello Spiritual, welcome to the New Thicket Inn! If you'll excuse me, I'm a bit busy copying this [scroll]. I'll be with you in a moment to chat, or to trade if you've come about the [earring]''
<br>You say, 'what earring'
<br>Rebecca Cabbageleaf looks up again, ''Oh, have you come about the earring then? That's wonderful! As you probably know, the druids have recently completed an ancient ceremony, and some delightful people who weren't druids were able to participate. Sadly though, only druid's were able to use the Earrings of Nature that were created with the ceremony. I've been collecting spare earrings of Nature from those who can't use them, and giving an Earring of the Solstice in return. It's a good deal all around, as we both can benefit from the trade. If you have an earring of Nature to trade, just give it to me and I'll happily swap you, and if you don't like it, you can give it back.''
<br>
