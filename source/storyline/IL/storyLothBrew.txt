<c "#66CCFF">Most information comes from the recipe guides found at http://www.eqtraders.com and cross referenced at http://www.magelo.com.  There has been extensive research put into getting the *real* in-game name of the finished products as well as the ingredients and implements used. Please don't be alarmed if the names aren't exactly as they appear on EQTraders because the item names shown here are the most correct.</c>
