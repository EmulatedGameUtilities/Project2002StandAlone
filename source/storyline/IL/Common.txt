Common Chat Terms<BR>
<BR>
The following terms are commonly used in EQ chat.  Some you may be familiar with because they are general internet chat or are general RPG game terms.  Some are specific to Everquest.<BR>

bait:  person who lures a monster in to a group and gets attacked first (see fetch)<BR>
bind:  Bind is a spell that changes where you will appear when you die or gate.  A magic user with the spell can bind himself anywhere or bind a group member within a town zone.<BR>
Blue:  A term for a monster that looks risky when you consider it, but is usually killable.  The message text comes in blue lettering.  So a player might say that its "blue to me"<BR>
brb:  Be right back.  Usually typed by a person who needs to run away from the keyboard for a quick soda, beer, relief, etc.<BR>
brt:  Be right there.<BR>
BSM:  Blood Stained Mantle.<BR>

Bubble:  Refers to the 5 sections on the colored bars for Experience, Stamina, Health and Mana.  When someone says that they only have one bubble to go to 11th level, or that are only at 2 bubbles of mana that is what they are referring to.<BR>
Buff or Buffing: Refers to casting skill or ability enhancing spells onto someone.<BR>
Camp:  Refers to the practice of sitting at a spawn point and waiting for monsters to regenerate and then picking them off as they appear.  Also, you exit the game by camping, so if a person says they are going to camp, they are leaving.<BR>
Con:  Typing /con or right clicking on a creature, NPC or player lets you consider it and tells you how they compare to you in level and how they feel about you.  You will often hear players talking about how a monster cons.<BR>
Corpse:  Seems obvious, but when a person dies he leaves behind a corpse which he need to find to get his stuff back.  People often shout to see if anyone has seen their corpse.  A good deed is to /tell someone if you have stumbled upon his corpse since it is highly possible he doesn't know exactly where it is.<BR>
