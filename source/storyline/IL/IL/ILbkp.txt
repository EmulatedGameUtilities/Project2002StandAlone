How ILs point system works<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 How Points are Awarded<br>
<br>
BKP is awarded to people, not toons or characters. What this means is Essej (Jesse Wooton) receives BKP for attending BKP events. Not Essej or one of my alts. If I play an alt, another persons character or even more than one character: Only Jesse receives BKP.<br>
<br>
A list of encounters is available that shows what events BKP is given for depending on your access level.<br>
<br>
Officers and BKP admins will be responsible for maintaining lists of who attended raids and entering the information into the system. Basically your name is recorded (the name of the persons playing main toon not what they are playing at that raid) and checked off in the system for the event you attended. The system does the rest =)<br>
<br>
-To participate in BKP and recieve full raid points you must be at least level 61. Only exception are guild members' main toons that are below that level for whatever reason, or alts if they are needed for the raid and an officer gave the ok.<br>
<br>
#NAME?
<br>
-Guild Recruits start at -15 BKP.<br>

Point Spending<br>
When an item drops all who are interested are welcome to "bid" on the item. This means send a tell to check if your points places you in the lead to recieve the item. We suggest knowing your point total and regularly checking that it is accurate.<br>
<br>
If you win an item the cost is deducted from your current points. If there are any questions regarding the cost of an item this forum provides threads to answer your questions or fix any problems.<br>
<br>
Our Interface<br>
<br>
Make sure to keep your profile current. I expect everyone to have a magelo account created and entered into their BKP profile. DPS and mana settings are not needed any longer.<br>
<br>
Please create profiles for your main toon and alts that are 50+. <br>
<br>
Flags: Please keep your flags updated in the bkp system. This is important for the officers to decide which flag mobs will have to be redone in the future<br>
