<c "#FF0000">Dropable loot is available to Full members only at this time (including tradeskill items)</c><br><br>
This is a guide to how it will be done. Its very much a work in progress, suggestions welcomed.<br><br>

1. Items that have a tradeskill label on them I collect on my mule in POK bank. Mostly interested in Elemental drops.<br><br>

2. When there are enough to attempt an item I do so, and foreward the success to general guild bank for distribution Via BKP (using standard BKP formula for dropable items ?) or 50% of current Plat value.<br><br>

3-6<br>
Diamonds - Sell to merchants.<br>
Raw Diamonds - Very few needed - Sell to merchants.<br>
Blue Diamonds - Sell to members at lowest bazaar price (Currently 275PP)<br>
Dust, Planar essence, Twilight worms, Wax Flowers & Ocean Ink - to rogues (Available, with no restrictions)<br><br>

7. Food items. Posted in forum and give to those who express an interest.<br><br>

8. Quest Items - When needed, at the stage when they can be used. If two at the same stage then based on Gross BKP.<br><br>

9. Mephit Bloods needed for Spell Creation. When Stocks exceed 1 stack handed out based on gross BKP.<br><br>

10. Excess stocks (multi stack oversupply)- Sold in Bazaar at an inflated price, after posting to find if any members needs)<br><br>

11. Where a member has made a reasonable effort to collect items for a combine (for a personal equipment upgrade), and is missing one (or one fails a precombine) Tradeskill Bank provides if there are excess in stock (excess being defined as over 10).<br><br>

12. None of the items provided By Tradebank to members are for resale. They are for personal equipment upgrades, unless otherwise stated eg. (Available, with no restrictions).<br><br>
