We have a lot of pride in being Angry Bunnies, both in what we have accomplished and in how we behave as a guild. That’s why we set the goal posts so high for new applicants. It should be a source of pride that you have been accepted to raid with us, as it means you have a reputation as being both skillful and honorable.<br><br> 

Hopefully over the next few months we can find out a bit more about you (and you can learn more about us), your skills, strengths, personality and character. Unfortunately not everyone is a good match and for a variety of reasons (sometimes reasons that may seem unfair) your raid approval may be terminated. Not everyone can be a bunny and we wish you the very best and hope you take with you the new skills and friendships that you have made while an applicant.<br><br> 

We don’t expect you to have a large amount of raiding experience as there are few guilds that can sustain a raid schedule even close to what we do. What we do expect is for you to listen, watch, ask questions and learn. Hopefully the mistakes you make will be small, but learn from them and make new mistakes. <br><br> 

Do you know who is leading the raid? Find out quick so you will know which voice to follow. Keep a pen and paper handy and make notes for each Target. <br><br> 

Who should you ask questions of? You can ask your Mentor (if you have one), a person of your class (or in your class channel) and even the baby bunny channel (depending on the question). Try to avoid using ILEVENT and raid channels for questions and fooling around. But it’s better to ask and seem a noob then to wipe the raid. If you don’t know what to do, then do nothing until you do.<br><br> 

If your AFK have your AFK tab up and make sure someone knows and that you are in a safe spot.<br><br> 

Beware of anger and frustration, they will lead to rash decisions and utterances.<br><br> 

If a member give you some advice, CONSIDER IT. It’s possible they have some experience that you do not. <br><br> 

Get your hotkeys fixed up NOW. Inability to follow directions for something so basic will not help your chances.<br><br> 

If you are missing a buff send a TELL to the person who can cast it. It never hurts to make sure they are in range (/tar vulcon) and you are not invisible. Most buffs will be MGBed at the beginning of a raid, and as they fall due during the raid.<br><br> 

If you are poisened send a tell to someone of a class that can heal you.<br><br> 

‘/LFG on” when forming a raid. Use “/say LFG” every 60 seconds if your in a rush (is your LFG really so special you need to spam the raid channel?). Drop Invisibility. If your a group leader check /who lfg REGULARLY till your group is full.<br><br> 

Beware of anger and frustration, they will lead to rash decisions and utterances.<br><br> 

Self invisibility, EB and sow are a must. Become self reliant.<br><br> 

In order to win loot you must have the most unspent BKP points. In addition Guild members are given preference over Applicants and Applicants over Guild member alts. I’d recommend waiting to see who bids on an item before bidding yourself. It all seems like such nice candy, but don’t distinguish yourself by bidding on every single item that drops, officers are very busy and spamming them when you have no chance of winning doesn’t help. Sometimes loot drops that is outside the BKP system (possibly a quest item?). Currently it will be assigned in order of Gross (the total amount ever earned) BKP. If mistakes are made relax, it’s not as though it will never drop again.<br><br> 
An example of a Bid.<br><br> 
/tell Morin I wish to bid on Uber_loot_01 . I have ~ 15 BKP.<br>

Flagging on raids is done in a similar fashion. Guild members are given preference over Applicants and Applicants over Guild member alts. Flags are an evil pushed upon us by Sony. Grin and bear it.<br><br> 

If you can buff, watch out for those getting a rez. Nothing is nicer then getting buffed without asking.<br><br> 

Please be aware that we expect a certain quality from both our members and applicants both in the game and when posting on other message boards. IL members as a rule do not post in response to guild bashing Flames (such as Iratus Lepus Kstole me and all the Phat Leet). In certain cases an officer, or a long standing member may feal a response is called for, but that would be a rare exception. Unanswered threads die quickly, and explanations, in most cases, merely extend the size and <br><br> duration of a flame. 

With every post/ooc/auction you are the public face of IL and maturity is expected.
