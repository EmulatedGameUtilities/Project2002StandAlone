<c "#FFFF00">Part 5: Tailoring</c> <br>
<br>
Skill requirement: 220 (or higher) Tailoring <br>
<br>
Flag requirement: Solusek Ro / Plane of Fire<br>
Your Flag MUST say - The true route to the Plane of Fire is now clear in your mind. <br>
<br>
After the grueling work of finding different components, the item Grimel wants you to make in Tailoring...is surprisingly simple--with the only risky step being the final combine. All it is essentially is a Robe of Eternal Fire with two extra, (relatively) easy to get components: A Vial of Purified Mana and your previous Signet. However, the success rate on the robe may drive you nuts. <br>

You say, 'I am skilled with the needle'<br>
Aid Grimel says 'I appreciate the help _____. I need a new tunic made for Councilman Taldarius. Last trip through the Plane of Disease, one of those flies spit mucus on him and it dripped through his armor seams! The result was a gooey mess that ate away all the leather underneath. It was a blessing he was wearing something under all that metal! Combine three firesilk swatches, a vial of purified mana, an emblem of fire, a firestrand curing agent, a tunic pattern and the signet. Bring it to me when you have completed it.' <br>

Aid Grimel inspects the tunic. 'Good work _____. This will definitely serve Councilman Taldarius well. Here take this! If you have skills with a fletching knife I may have a job for you to do.' <br>
