<c "#FFff00">Part 6: Fletching</c> <br>
<br>
Skill Requirement: 220 (or higher) Fletching <br>
<br>
Flag Requirement: Rallos Zek<br>
Your Flag MUST say - The parchment of Rallos are scribed in a language you cannot comprehend; they do however have detailed drawings of the manaetic behemoth you have already destroyed. (Or something roughly to that extent) <br>
<br>
Now that the evil robe is done, on to Fletching! If you don't know a tinkerer, this step will be even more annoying. Otherwise it is as difficult as making a Featherwood Compound Bow. <br>

You say, 'I am skilled with a fletching knife' <br>
Aid Grimel says 'Aye I can see you are skilled with the fletching knife _____. It is good too, I need to replace Councilman Taldarius's bow from Plane of Air. Combine a planing tool, two wind metal bow cams, an air arachnid silk string, a featherwood staff and the signet. I hope the bow will be up to his standards, he sure loved his old bow.' <br>

Aid Grimel says 'Masterful work _____! I can see your skill in the curves of the bow. Take this as a sign of my respect for your skill. The last item I need before we can be off is some food. I warn you this will truly test your skills. Do you fancy yourself a master chef?' <br>
