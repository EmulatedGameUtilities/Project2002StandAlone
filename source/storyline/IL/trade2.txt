Baking you need a high Wis OR Int to Skillup<br>
<br>
Get out your smith/potter and make pie tin, non-stick frying pan & casserole dish. Jaggedpine Forest is a zone you will be visiting a lot. So if evil use an alt for supplies.<br>
eqtrader.com (use search a LOT)<br>
<br>
Fish rolls - Fish, batwings in a spit or oven till skill 135<br>
(all store bought. Knock yourself out)<br>
<br>
Patty melt - bear meat OR lion meat OR wolf meat, loaf of bread, cheese<br>
in a spit or oven (include a non-stick frying pan (crafted) which is always returned) till skill 191.<br>
(all store bought. Knock yourself out)<br>
<br>
If you have access to POS <br>
storm salmon fillet - storm salmon, jug of sauces in the PoN Oven till 202<br>
(Storm salmon fished in POS. Took me 4 hours to get 10 stacks or so - from memory)<br>
<br>
If you have access to Plane of Water (ty Xora)<br>
Giant Halibut Steak trivials at 208 <br>
Breaded Giant Snapper/Halibut trivials at 222<br>
<br>
Halas 10 lb meat pie - 2 clumps dough, wolf fillet in cream, bear fillet in cream, lion fillet in cream, mammoth fillet in cream, sage leaf (alchamy supply) in a spit or oven (include pie tin (crafted) - always returned) till skill 226<br>
Lots of precombines here. You will need to farm eggs, mammoth meat & wolf meat. Or just buy as they become available in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
Now for your Final Push to 250. Use these 3 recipies as components become available. Look for anaconda meat, griffon meat & Plant shoots from Jaggedpine Forest (or in bazaar). All else is merchant bought.<br>
<br>
Anaconda melt - anaconda meat, loaf of bread & cheese in a spit or oven (include a non-stick frying pan - always returned)<br>
<br>
Griffon melt - griffon meat, loaf of bread & cheese in a spit or oven (include a non-stick frying pan - always returned)<br>
<br>
Cheesy vegetable casserole - plant shoots, cheese, noodles in a spit or oven (include a casserole dish - always returned). You can forage the plant shoots while hunting griffons and anaconda in Jaggedpine Forest. You will also need eggs for this recipy.<br>
<br>
Bingo you are at skill 250. Takes less then a week if you work at it.<br>
<br>
I may have left out something, but this seems the simplest way. If you have the Plat buy Mammoth, Anaconda & Griffon meat for 10pp to speed it up.<br>
