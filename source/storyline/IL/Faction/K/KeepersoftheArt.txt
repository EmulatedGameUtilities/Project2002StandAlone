<br>Faction: <c "#FFFF00">Keepers of the Art</c>
<br>Description: Keepers of the Art are the magic-users operating out of Felwithe. They have a strong sense of loyalty to the magical forces of Norrath, and several quests require quite a high faction standing with these before they will give you the quests. The easiest way to raise this faction is by giving batwings to the magician guildmaster in Felwithe.
