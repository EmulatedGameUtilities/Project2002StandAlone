<br>Faction: <c "#FFFF00">Beta Neutral</c>
<br>Description: Beta Neutral is generally referred to as the faction most key point NPCs belong to. Fx the emperor for the Old Sebilis Key as well as most NPCs for epic Quests, who exchange items. It is generally thought to be a faction that is used when a quest should be open to anyone no matter how they play or have played, faction-wise.
<br>In the later stages of the Rogue Redemption quest, if you give the Sparkle Purse (dropped by Lynada the Exiled in SolA) to Noresa Sparkle in WC, she raises this faction, and if you give the gem case and both keys to Bubar in EC tunnel, he also raises this faction.
