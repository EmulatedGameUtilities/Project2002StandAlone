Grab a Pole, Bait and some water. Stand beside the water and use the ability "fishing".
Do untill 200. (This is not rocket science) If you going to combine with baking fish in POW or POS<br>

----------------<br>
Some fishing spots: <br>
NRo near Barbarian huts <br>
Freeport dock <br>
BB dock <br>
EK river, vendor at farmer's place. <br>
FG at vendor's area (but need to watch out for train) <br>
<br>
Need more dark race spots...don't know any besides FG. <br>
<br>
Fisherman's Companion (http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/PoP_PoKfishing.htm) is a good thing to have since it summons fishing poles, and the fishing pole summons ale, so you can work on fishing & AT at the same time if you don't mind the int/wis drop. Just don't fall into the water, drunken swimming ain't fun. <br>
<br>
Sure wish the pole summons bait...or even better, summons bait + beer. <br>
