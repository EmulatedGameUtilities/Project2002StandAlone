/loc (or /l) --  You may want to put this command in your hot keys so that you can use it when you are about to die.  Then you only have to scroll back up to see where your corpse is located.  You can also use /loc to keep track of important locations within a zone or to coordinate positions with a friend.  It gives you an X-Y set of coordinates of where you are or where the object you are targeting is.   It works as follows:  X - This is your North/South direction.  The higher the number, the further North you are, and the lower the number the further South you are.  Y - This is your East/West direction.  The higher the number, the further West you are, and the lower the number, the further East you are.  If you're trying to track down something and you have the coordinates but don't want to deal with the North/East/South/West thing, all you have to do is start walking around while rapidly using the /loc command and see the difference in x,y while you walk in different direcitions.  If your current x is higher than the x you're trying to find, change directions until x starts to get smaller.  If you keep using /loc you should narrow in on an x,y location very quickly.  Remember to be in the same zone though.   (Thanks to Zauron for the input on /loc) <br>
/log on or off -- turns on the feature that copies your log to a text file in your EQ directory. <br>
/loot - loots a corpse which is located in shallow water or lava, keeping you from having to go in yourself. <br>

When you have this set to never, you will never get a confirmation box to see if you want to loot or not. <br>
/mcicontrol – Allows a player to control sound devices such as cdaudio or mp3s to play when in-game.  This command will be further developed in the future to be more user friendly. <br>
/mousespeed [0-3] – Changes the mouse travel speed across the monitor.  3 is the maximum setting (the higher the number the faster the mouse moves).  Don't set this above 3.  Your mouse will move too quickly and you will probably not be able to play. <br>

/note <text> - Allows the player to write notes when in-game to be referenced later out of game.  This creates a notes.txt file of the text.  Each line of text sent using /note is appended to the end of this file.  There is a maximum number of 455 characters when creating a note. <br>
