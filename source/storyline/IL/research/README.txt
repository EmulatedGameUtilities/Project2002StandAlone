Thanks to Ramsus for the original compilation Spell Research Information Guide. I made a slight 
modification to component list to sort by component types like Runes and Words. Also, I included
the WIS Spell Class Research. Many of us will be collecting components for several classes, I 
wanted to find information quicker from Merchant Mining, Bazaar Searching and Mob Drops.
