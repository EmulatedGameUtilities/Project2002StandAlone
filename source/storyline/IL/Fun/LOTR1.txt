EQ's Fellowship of the Ring: Part One       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
HOBBITON, IN THE SHIRE <BR>
<BR>
Bilbo: Well, I think I am going to quit EQ and delete my character. You want any of my stuff, Frodo? <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: Sure, but I thought the Sackville-Bagginses wanted all your stuff if you quit. <BR>
<BR>
Bilbo: Aw, screw them. They are always begging me for stuff. I'd rather give it to you. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: Sweet. What's the ring do? <BR>
<BR>
Bilbo: Well, it makes you invisible, and it has some uber focus effect that only works at level 65. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: Come on, the level cap is at 50! Who is level 65 except for Gods or something? <BR>
<BR>
Gandalf: <coughs loudly> <BR>
<BR>
Bilbo: Something like that. Anyway, we are having a party soon to work on alcohol tolerance. I'll make my announcement then. <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER <BR>
<BR>
You have increased your skill in Alcohol Tolerance! (100) <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: /shout SWEET! I NM A MQSTER ALZOHOPIC!!! <BR>
<BR>
Pippin: /shout Grats! Where can I get some? <BR>
<BR>
Merry: /shout way to go Frodo! <BR>
<BR>
Bilbo: /shout I have an announcement to make! I am leaving EQ! <BR>
<BR>
Fatty Bolger: Sweet - can I have your frost giant steaks? <BR>
<BR>
Bilbo: /shout and I am leaving everything to Frodo so stop asking me for stuff you stupid beggars! <BR>
<BR>
Fatty Bolger: /tell Frodo hey man can I have the frost giant steaks? <BR>
<BR>
BACK IN BAG END <BR>
<BR>
Gandalf: Well Frodo, I guess I should tell you something. Remember when you turned in that book to the Priest of Discord and I told you that was really, really dumb? Well, there is an uber PKer that is coming to kill you and loot the ring. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: What? What are you taking about? <BR>
<BR>
Gandalf: An SK named Sauron is planning to get your ring from you - you know, the one that Bilbo gave you? Well, this guy wants it. He has organized an uber guild of evil toons to come find you and get it. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: So what should I do? If I stay in Hobbiton and everyone gets killed they will all blame me. <BR>
<BR>
Gandalf: Better leave the shire. I'll meet you a couple of zones over in Bree. At least there the guards can slow them down some if they come after you. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: They can kill guards? I am so screwed. <BR>
<BR>
Gandalf: Don't worry, I have gotten a few people together to help you - Samwise is here, and I will join you later. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: He's wearing cloth armor! How is he supposed to help me?!? <BR>
<BR>
Gandalf has left the group. <BR>
<BR>
Merry: Hail, Samwise. Hail, Frodo. <BR>
<BR>
Pippin: We have been working on our foraging skill. I have a whole stack of vegetables! <BR>
<BR>
Farmer Maggot: Get out of my field! It's halflings like you who have ruined your own lands! <BR>
<BR>
Merry: Rogues don't have foraging you pinhead. Those are ground spawn and you aggroed the farmer you moron! <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: DOH! Let's get out of here! <BR>
<BR>
Samwise: Following Pippin <BR>
<BR>
Merry: Following Pippin <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: Following Pippin. <BR>
<BR>
Pippin: Don't worry, I know a shortcut! <BR>
<BR>
Samwise: Just don't lead us off a cliff. <BR>
<BR>
Pippin: Who, me? <BR>
<BR>
You have taken 17 points of non-melee damage! <BR>
You have taken 54 points of non-melee damage! <BR>
You have taken 22 points of non-melee damage! <BR>
<BR>
THE PRANCING PONY, IN BREE <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: There's the Prancing Pony. Time to work on alcohol tolerance! <BR>
<BR>
Pippin: Sweet! I bought a whole stack of ales! <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: Hey, Gandalf is not in the zone. WTF? <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: Hail, Frodo. Gandalf couldn't make it, he got stuck in Isengard and had to log. He told me to meet you here. I'm Strider. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: Then why does it say Aragorn above your head? <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: Umm... <BR>
<BR>
TO BE CONTINUED<BR>
 <BR>
EQ's Fellowship of the Ring: Part Two       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
IN AN INN IN THE VILLAGE OF BREE <BR>
<BR>
Pippin: Why do they even have inns in this game? You don't sleep, you can't lie down, you can't shack up with some elf hottie - hell, you can't even lock the damn door! <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: Quit whining and listen - I see some Nazgul on track, so I am going to camo you guys so we can hide. They are almost certainly coming here. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: What are they? <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: They are the Nazgul - the Ring Wraiths. They were once ordinary toons. Then they got sucked in by the EverCrack experience and they can't get enough no matter how much they play. They are the level 60 plus uber PKers who play for 16 hours a day. They are all 19 year old college students who blow all their parents tuition money by skipping class and staying in their dorm rooms to play EQ all the time. They never leave their PCs to shower or to eat or anything. They will never rest and they will never stop hunting you. You are SO fucked. <BR>
<BR>
Pippin: I knew I should have found a different group. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: Damn, I am going to have to cough up $50 to switch servers, aren't I? <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: OK I am going to scout around. Stay here. Please don't do anything stupid. I know it's hard, especially for you, Pippin. <BR>
<BR>
Pippin: Eat me, treehugger. <BR>
<BR>
Samwise: Speaking of eating, let's work on baking a while since we have to sit here. I brought my spit! <BR>
<BR>
Merry: If eating was a trade skill, you would be a grandmaster. <BR>
<BR>
Samwise: Yeah, and if fudgepacking was a trade skill you and your butt-buddy Pippin over there would be grandmasters. At least we can't get into trouble cooking and eating. Now what was the stuff I needed for that recipe again? <BR>
<BR>
Samwise: /ooc does anyone remember what you need for Misty Thicket picnic? <BR>
<BR>
Nazgul: /shout Yeah, just tell me where you are and i will show you! <BR>
<BR>
Pippin: /shout OK loc is pos 628 neg 1230! <BR>
<BR>
Nazgul: /shout on my way! He, he he! <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: Only you guys could find a way to get into trouble while working on baking skill. We better get Frodo some help before this DOT kills him. This DOT is beyond my powers to heal. Minor healing suxxors, and I have no mana anyway. <BR>
<BR>
Samwise: I KNEW we should have brought a cleric! <BR>
<BR>
Arwen: Hail, Aragorn. I'm wearing a thong under this robe. <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: No time for cyber now babe - gotta get this halfling to a cleric. <BR>
<BR>
Arwen: We'll take him to my dad - he's a pallie - he can cast one of those remove curse thingys and heal him all up too. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo: Hurry up - losing HPs fast here. Can I at least see some cleavage before I die? <BR>
<BR>
Samwise: Hurry up and get him out of here! <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: How noble of you Sam - always thinking of your friend. <BR>
<BR>
Samwise: Are you kidding? I want him the hell away from me. I don't want to lose my level when they come back here for him. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo makes a rude gesture at Samwise. <BR>
<BR>
Arwen: OK meet me in Rivendell you guys. <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: /tell Arwen can we still cyber later? <BR>
<BR>
Arwen: /reply Sure... you know in RL I am a fat balding 40 year old man, right? <BR>
<BR>
Aragorn: /ignore Arwen <BR>
<BR>
EQ's Fellowship of the Ring: Part Three       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND, IN RIVENDELL <BR>
<BR>
Well, it's not REALLY Elrond's house per se, because this isn't EQ II and no one actually has their own house. It's more like the empty hut that Elrond likes to hang out in when he's logged in and not on some uber-raid. But anyway.... <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Well, that was close. Thanks for the remove curse and heals, dude. <BR>
<BR>
ELROND: No problem. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Sorry about that earlier crack about getting you the hell away from me. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Yeah, well, it happens. There are times when I want you the hell away from me too, so we're even. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: We have been worried about that PKer guild for a while. I think we are going to have to do something about them. We may have to call a guild meeting, Elrond. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Oh, come on, I just wanted to make sure we got Frodo taken care of before I logged off. Don't tell me we're about to have one of those long-ass guild meetings. <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER: <BR>
<BR>
ELROND: OK everyone, we have called all of you together to decide what the hell we are going to do about this stupid ring thingy. Anyone have any ideas? <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: /em farts loudly <BR>
<BR>
GLOIN: /em chuckles. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: /em belches loudly. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: /em groans. <BR>
<BR>
ELROND: Well, thanks for that valuable input. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Why doesn't Frodo just destroy the stupid thing? How hard could it be to click the little destroy button? <BR>
<BR>
ELROND: Well, actually there's a bug that won't let you destroy the ring anywhere except in the Mount Doom zone. Go figure. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Gee, it's only one of the toughest zones in the game. And you have to go all the way through all the Mordor zones to get there. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Come on, just petition someone to fix the bug and then we can forget about the whole thing. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Are you stupid? When was the last time a petition actually fixed anything? GMs are totally worthless. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: /em coughs loudly. <BR>
<BR>
ELROND: OK, so we are going to have to take the ring to Mount Doom to destroy it. Who wants to go? <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Why destroy it? Just give me the ring and delete your toon - no one will know. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: No way. THis is my first and favorite toon. I'll transfer to another server before I delete it. I'll just take the ring to Mordor myself if I have to so screw you guys. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: What the hell, I'll go with you. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: And so will I. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Did any of you know that Arwen was a guy? <BR>
<BR>
ELROND: What? No she isn't. She's my real life 18 year old daughter. Actually she's a budding supermodel. I told her to tell people that she's a fat balding 40 year old man just so they would leave her alone. At least until she gets over her little nymphomania stage. What brought that up anyway? <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Oh... uh, nothing. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /tell Frodo Goddammit! How do I unremove someone from my ignore list? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: /reply Aw man, I think it's too late - she's thinking about transferring to the Grey Havens server. You may as well just come with us. <BR>
<BR>
ELROND: Very well then, all of you form a raid. The channel will be fellowshipofthering. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Can't you give a nice easy short name? Like, uh, Bob? <BR>
<BR>
ELROND: /em rolls his eyes.<BR>
 <BR>
EQ's Fellowship of the Ring: Part Four       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS, NOWHERE NEAR THE PASS OF CARADRAS <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Are you sure the zone to Caradras is around here? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Yeah, pretty sure. Saruman gave me the coordinates. I don't get it. We should be able to see it from here. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Wait a sec - you said Saruman gave you the coordinates? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Yeah.... <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: /em groans loudly. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: /em rolls his eyes. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: I thought you said Saruman betrayed you. So why the hell would you think he was honest about where the goddam pass was?!? <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: DOH! <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Aw... shit. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Screw this. I say we go through the Mines of Moria zone. It's supposed to be a level 30 something zone. My RL cousin Balin is in there with his guild and they can make sure we get through there OK. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Sounds like a plan. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Yeah, let's go. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: I dunno... I think that's a bad idea... let's keep looking for the pass. <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Are you kidding? I've been getting the "You are out of food and drink" mesage for the last twenty minutes. Let's get the hell out of here. <BR>
<BR>
SOMEWHERE IN THE SOE OFFICE <BR>
<BR>
SARUMAN: So... you fear to go into those mines, huh Gandalf? You know that we revamped the zone and filled it with uber mobs that would make level 60 toons wet their drawers and run screaming like 6 year old girls that just saw a snake. He, he, he. <BR>
<BR>
JUST OUTSIDE THE GATES OF MORIA <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Hey, I got this thing on track called the Watcher in the Water. It's red - anyone know anything about it? <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: No, but tell me where it is and maybe I can throw some rocks at it. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Tell me again why we brought you along on this trip? <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Because you needed people of intelligence on this mission quest thingie. <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: /em bitch-slaps Pippin for being such an idiot. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: So anyone know how to open this door? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Sure, I have it here... I printed it out from Allakhazam... crap it's buried here on my desk somewhere... <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: I wonder what the aggro radius on that thing is... <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Bind my soul... no, wait that's not it. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Pipin, if you aggro that thing I am going to be REALLY pissed. <BR>
<BR>
WATCHER IN THE WATER: AAAAARGH! It's halflings like you who have ruined your own la... errr, I mean water! You'll not ruin mine! <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Wait, I got it! Open sesame! <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Mellon, you stupid door. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Cool, it opened! <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: What the hell kind of a password is "melon"?!?<BR>
 <BR>
EQ's Fellowship of the Ring: Part Five       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
DEEP WITHIN THE MINES OF MORIA <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Soon, we will all get to experience the fabled hospitality of the dwarves... roaring fires... malt beer... table dances from elf hotties... <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: /em rolls his eyes. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Aw, come on! You think I want a table dance from a chick with a beard? <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Umm... anyone notice all the corpses here at the zone entrance? There seems to be an awful lot of them... <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Hey, these are all guys from my cousin's guild. I'll send him a tell. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: /tell Balin hey man you guys need a rezz while I have a pallie with me? <BR>
<BR>
Balin is not online at this time. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Uh, oh. He's not online. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Well, it's going to take a while to get through here. Don't worry, I have the map from Allkhazam... on my desk somewhere.... <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: /em groans loudly. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Hey, is it me or is there something back there following us? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: It's Gollem. He's been following us for three days. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: I still can't believe they made frogloks a playable race. They have tracking now too? Bilbo should have killed that little 7ytqi' when he had the chance. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Do not be so hasty to deal out death and judgement. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Wow, I hadn't thought about it that way. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Plus if he does anything stupid I will ban him from the game and close his account. <BR>
<BR>
A LONG WHILE LATER: <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: So do we have any idea where the hell we are? I have to log off in a while and we haven't done shit. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Ah! That way! <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: You remembered? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: No, I found the map I printed out from EQ Atlas. It was under this old pizza box. <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: The wealth of Moria was not in gold of jewels, but in Mithril. All sorts of smiths used to come down here to get it. It's common ground spawn here and is worth a pile of plat. <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: So why isn't everyone down here trying to get it? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Well, err... the zone was kind of, um, reworked a bit... so it's a bit tougher. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Gee... why didn't you mention that before? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: It uh, slipped my mind. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Like how tougher? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Well, let's just say that sometimes even GMs have to get rezzes. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: /em soils his pants. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: How did I get into this mess? Why am I here? Maybe deleting this toon isn't such a bad idea after all. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Well, we should be fine as long as we don't aggro everything in the zone. The only way to do that is to /shout stuff. That will pull everything right to you. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: /shout Hey, has anyone seen any mithril yet? PST! <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: OMFG you are an ASSHOLE!!!! <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: /duel Pippin. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Can you ban him please? <BR>
<BR>
TO BE CONTINUED<BR>
 <BR>
EQ's Fellowship of the Ring: Part Six       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
DEEP IN THE MINES OF MORIA <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: I am so glad we have you guys with us - cloth armor, rusty weapons, no weapon skills to speak of... you hit that last one for what, 8 points of damage? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Well, maybe if we had a few more useful tanks instead of a couple of rangers we would be doing better. <BR>
<BR>
Legolas makes a rude gesture at Frodo. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: An 18 year old nympho supermodel... dammit... <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Holy shit. That was some train. And I can hear more of them coming. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: I didn't know there were that many orcs in the whole world. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Man, my blade is glowing blue. This has to be the most lame effect on any weapon ever. No proc, no stat buffs, just glowing blue when the orc is close enough to chop you in half. What a gift. Thanks, Uncle Bilbo, you cheap bastard. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Let them come! We can take them! <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Well, this might be the time to run like hell. UBER TRAIN TO ZONE!!! <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Can I turn auto-follow on? I need to take a leak. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Hey, there's something on track called a Balrog. Anyone know what the hell that is? It looks like it is getting closer. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: If anyone is using a no-rent container, I recommend moving your stuff now. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER, AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE LORIEN ZONE <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Well, you know you were in deep doo-doo when the GM with you gets killed. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: How can we get him a rezz when we can't even get his corpse back? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: I knew I should have deleted this toon. I wish none of this had happened. I am going to kill Bilbo the next time I see him. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Well, let's take a breather and camp here a sec. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: No, we need to keep going - a lot of orcs will spawn at the zone entrance here so we need to head further in where the guards will kill them. Besides, I think maybe we can get rid of the ring here. I will try prodding some of those NPCs in the zone and see if they say anythng about it. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: I heard that if you say the wrong thing, that high elf enchantress will kill you. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: What wrong thing? <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Are you kidding? If I tell you, you will say it for sure and get us all killed. I have seen how you work, young hobbit shit-for-brains. If I was group leader your ass would be gone. <BR>
<BR>
Pippin makes a rude gesture at Gimli. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: If only I had known that Arwen really was an 18 year old nympho... dammit....<BR>
 <BR>
EQ's Fellowship of the Ring: Part Seven       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
LOTHLORIEN, DEEP IN THE WOODS OF LORIEN <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: OK I am taking over as raid leader. Please let me talk to these NPCs. Everyone else keep your mouth shut. Okay? <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: /em rolls his eyes. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Hail, Haldir. <BR>
<BR>
HALDIR: Hail, Aragorn! Have you come on an [errand for the Dunedain] or have you [brought great evil with you]? <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: I have brought great evil with me. <BR>
<BR>
HALDIR: WHAT?!? Come with me! Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel will wish to see you at once! <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: OK, follow me, and don't use autofollow, because you WILL fall off these trees. <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER: <BR>
<BR>
GALADRIEL: The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little, and it will fail. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: /g hey, I conned her and she glowered and me dubiously... what the hell does that mean? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: /g I knew it! I KNEW you had screwed up your faction with these guys! <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: /g Screw you, midget! If you would have just given me the damn ring we wouldn't even be here! <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: /g hey, what can we say to her to make her freak out? <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: /em rolls his eyes. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Hey, I want the phat lewtz! <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: They are conning dubious to me too, the racist bastards. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Well, we said the right stuff so now they are going to let us pass through, plus they are going to give us some cool stuff. Sweet! <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Awesome! What sort of stuff? <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Dunno, it's totally random. Might be phat, might be lame. <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER, ON THE RIVER ANDUIN <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: I hate boats. This sucks. Why the hell did Verant put these long-ass boat rides in the game? Did they really think it would be fun to sit on a boat for half an hour? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: You're just mad because your gift sucked ass. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Of course it sucked ass! I got a cloth cord! What the hell is a damn cloth cord good for?!? I might as well be turning in orc belts! <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Hey, Gimli, how did you find out about that little Easter Egg thing? <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Oh, you mean when she asked me what I wanted? I read it on some board somewhere. They told me that if I said "I only wish to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time, because she is more fair than all the jewels under the earth" that it would boost my faction to maxxed ally and she would give me a lap dance. It was cool... I had never seen a toon disrobe and move like that before... some Verant programmer must be a total perv. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: And it worked?!? DAMN... <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: What can I say... we dwarves are sexy bitches. But I think Celeborn is dubious to me now.<BR>
 <BR>
EQ's Fellowship of the Ring: Part Eight       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
AT A SMALL COVE NEAR THE FALLS OF RAUROS <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: OK, we will camp here tonight and then cross tomorrow when we all log back on. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Is that a good idea? I mean, maybe we should just go ahead and camp closer to the Mordor zone line. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Who's leading this raid? Respect mah authoritah! <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Heir to the throne my ass. You're such a moron. <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Hey, Frodo, you really shouldn't wander far. We don't know what might be lurking out here. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Yeah, whatever. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: /duel Frodo. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Are you joking? Uh, no. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: OK then, just give me the ring. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: No. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: But you don't want it! <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Yeah, but if I give it to you it will end up for sale in the Bazaar and some moron will get it. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Give it to me! <BR>
<BR>
Frodo fades away. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Fine, OK I'm sorry... but can I still have the ring? <BR>
<BR>
BACK AT THE CAMP <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Where did Frodo wander off to? And where is Boromir? <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Maybe they're off cybering somewhere. <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Jealous? <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: /em rolls his eyes. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Uh-oh - I have a bunch of Uruk-Hai on track and they're getting close - we better go find them. <BR>
<BR>
URUK-HAI: Orc smash, orc kill!! Orc weapons your blood will spill! <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Well, should I use the reforged sword made from Narsil, sword of Elendil or that cheap green piece of crap I got in the bazaar? Which one has more dps guys? <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Quick, Merry! Taunt those guys off of Frodo! <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Yeah, taunt them off me! <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: And then I'll taunt them off you guys! <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: And then we'll just stand here instead of running or fighting! <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Wait, who the hell is the main tank here? Me or Boromir? <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: Who the hell is the healer? THAT'S what I want to know! <BR>
<BR>
An Uruk-Hai scores a critical hit on Boromir! (104) <BR>
<BR>
Boromir has been slain by an Uruk-Hai! <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Holy shit! The rezzer has died! <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: We are so screwed! Why don't we have a cleric?!? <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: We didn't think we needed one, because Legolas and I can heal some and so can Boromir. <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Come on! Who the hell uses a ranger for healing? And two rangers isn't any better, I'm sorry. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Well, maybe if we hadn't brought so many little halfling rogues along, we could have had more space for a cleric or a shaman or something. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: /g Aw, shit... I am bound in Rivendell! AAAARGH! <BR>
<BR>
[To Aragorn] You have been given permision to drag Boromir's corpse. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /g Don't worry, I'll drag your corpse onto the boat so it will head down to Minas Tirith. Then you can just meet it there. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: /g what?!? Are you crazy? It will rot! Something will go wrong, I know it! <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /g uh... ooops... the boat went over the falls. <BR>
<BR>
BOROMIR: /g Thanks a lot asshole! I am SO reporting you! <BR>
<BR>
MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE BEACH <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: That's it, these morons are going to get me killed. I am so out of here. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Hey, you are NOT leaving me with these guys! <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Watch me. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Well, who has the weight-reducing containers and all the food, hmm? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Shit... OK, you can come with me. <BR>
<BR>
Frodo has left the raid. <BR>
<BR>
Samwise has left the raid. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: WTF?!? We come all this way to protect these guys and they ditch us in the middle of a fight? <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Well, at least our main looters are still with us. <BR>
<BR>
Merry has left the raid. <BR>
<BR>
Pippin has left the raid. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: DOH!!!!<BR>
