I logged on last night to get a little exp ya know. Been working on AA lately, want to get Run3 so peeps will stop leaving me behind when travelling. That crap is ssoo annoying, and friggin rude. <br><br>

Anyway, I go /lfg and it's not long before I get an invite to a PoN group. I'm like "What camp?" - "Caves" - /r "cool, Who is in group?" - "chanter, shammy, druid, warrior, rogue" /r "No, I mean who is in the group, names please, I need to make sure none of them are on my SL". At first he is like /boggle , apparantly he hasn't read my rules yet (pub21.ezboard.com/fquon91...=1.topic), but he finally gives me the names of everyone in the group and I check them against my alphabetized excel spreadsheet. Luckily none were on there so I head to PoN. I zone in and do a quick /shout "Quon here, REPRESENT!" , then I spin around and find the guy who sent me the tell. Mouselook spins are the shizznit.<br><br>

As soon as I get invited to group I start bustin down my expectations. <br><br>

/tell druid "don't be laying down any gimp heals unless I ask ok? I'll be dropping the Big Heal Bomb so there is no reason for you to waste mana, you should dot or something, or just chill and soak up the exp waiting for us to need an evac." He responds with some garbage about being able to spot heal, nuke, snares etc.. I /r "Please don't argue with the Quon. Besides you're the one who rolled up a Halfling, the least you could have done was make a Wood Elf Honie for me to look at"<br><br>

/tell enchanter "Yo, KEI. And why do I have to ask you for the only thing you got invited to this group for?"<br><br>

/tell warrior "I'm going to initiate you into the purple club tonight." He says "?" /r "You'll see soon enough  "..Another person that hasn't read my rules, I'm going to need to get more exposure.<br><br>

/tell rogue "I bet you can generate a lot of aggro eh?" She says " I sure can  " /r "Well don't, you are dead last on my list of peeps to heal since there is no Ranger in the group." She responded but I was already typing my message to the shaman and I missed it, and didn't feel like scrolling back.<br><br>

/tell shaman "I'm not sure I trust this enchanter, can you keep an eye on me with root crowd control please?" He's like "I'll do my best" /r "WTF?? If I die, we all go down, you better respect that." I think for a minute about adding him to my @#%$ List for that lame ass attitude, but I let it go this time.<br><br>

/group "I get all money drops right to replenish my expenditures?" The groupleader, the warrior, says "We'll be splitting any loot at the end." /group "If you all want aego, I better see 60 platz in my trade window" The warrior repeats himself, so I wait for the 40pp to show up in my window. Time wasted 5 minutes. I can see this group is turning out to be very Non-Quonesque.<br><br>


Buffs done and we rock toward the gobbie cave. I'm amazed that I didn't have to ask for levi and invis with these assclowns.<br><br>

We set up and the warrior pulls the first 2 gobs. The fingertwiddler to my right manages to mez one so everybody is on the gob. I figure I'm going to go ahead and get the warrior into my purple club right away. (If you don't know what the purple club is by now, go back and read my commandments, it's like the first friggin one.) Warrior gets to about 50% and I ask him, "How many HP's you got?", by the time he responds he's down to like 30%. The timing on this @#%$ has got to be square ya know. I drop the big heal bomb on the meat shield with the Hot Key Macro "<Warrior> may you live to protect The Quon another day". I have like 2 hot key banks full of TIIIGHHT hot key macro messages. Because this clown waited so long to tell me how many HP's he had the heal bomb landed a split second to late. Now we are tankless, and I'm sitting in a frickin cave with 4 asshats and no tank. I think "WWQD?" (What Would Quon Do?), and I'm blessed with the answer, /sit, /load gate, /cast gate, and slicker than @#%$ I'm back in the Nexus safe and sound. <br><br>

I decide that those freaks don't know WTF they are doing so I /groupsay "Yo, dudes, I'm gonna bust outta here and see if I can get a PoV group, Caves exp suxxors. And FYI, next time you want to group with me, someone in the group needs to read the commandments, Yo". /disband<br><br>


The Quon". I want the respect, I want the platinum, I want the excitement, and I want the Wood Elf Honies all on my tip. Yeah..."The Quon". Represent. <br><br>
