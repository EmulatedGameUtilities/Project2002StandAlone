EQ's The Two Towers: Part One       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
/ooc <BR>
<BR>
OK, I know that someone else has already done a version of this for the Two Towers but theirs is awfully short so I thought I would have a go at it. <BR>
<BR>
/ooc off <BR>
<BR>
SOMEWHERE ON THE EDGE OF THE EMYN MUIL <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: /shout GANDALF!!! <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: What is it, Mr. Frodo? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Nothing - just a dream.... <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: About??? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Gandalf fought this really big uber mob, then used his magical GM powers to get rid of this ring and powerlevel me up to 65, that's all. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: How do you dream in EQ? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: I fell asleep at my computer. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: I can buy that, but why would you bother to type "GANDALF!" instead of just shouting it in RL? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Uh... <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: I mean are we in EQ or are we in a Monty Python skit? Come on! <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: You know, this zone is got to be the most useless zone ever. No one ever comes here and nothing good drops. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Tell me about it. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: And get this - I did a /who and that Gollem guy keeps popping up. <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: He wants the ring, that stupid little froglok. <BR>
<BR>
GOLLEM: Thieves. The filthy little thieves. Ninja looted my precious, yessss. And we wants it! <BR>
<BR>
Gollem punches Frodo for 5 points of damage! <BR>
Gollem kicks Frodo for 7 points of damage! <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: Now see, Gandalf was right - you never should have turned in that book to the Priest of Discord. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Will you get this t'wqpsn off me please? <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: /assist Frodo <BR>
<BR>
Samwise has punched Gollem for 8 points of damage! <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: /g try equipping your sword you moron! <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: /g uh, wait where is it? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: /g nm, I have mine! <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Ok Gollem, back off or I will slash you with my awesome sword - and it has bane damage against frogloks so watch it! <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: /g it does? <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: /g Shhh! He doesn't know that! <BR>
<BR>
GOLLEM: /cries <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: What a whiny little bitch. Let's just kill him here - he'll never find his corpse. <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Why would he want to? Have you inspected him? He has nothing but a tattered cloth skirt on. What is that, like +2 AC? You're pathetic, Gollem. Your corpse isn't even worth looting. <BR>
<BR>
GOLLEM: /cries <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: Say, you know the way through the Mordor zone, don't you? <BR>
<BR>
GOLLEM: Yes... <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: You will take us to the Black Gate. And don't even think about doing anything funny. We have a friend who is a GM and we will get your account banned, you little turd. <BR>
<BR>
GOLLEM: NO!!! I swears to help the Master of the Precious! We be nice to the hobbitses if they be nice to us! Please don't take away my EQ priveliges (GOLLEM, GOLLEM)! <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: We know your name, you stupid froggie bastard, you don't have to tell us - it's RIGHT ABOVE YOUR HEAD IN BIG PURPLE LETTERS! <BR>
<BR>
FRODO: What kind of an idiot repeats their own name over and over again? <BR>
<BR>
SAMWISE: What kind of an idiot names themselves after some sort of weird cough? Who are your siblings, Hiccup, Burp and Fart? <BR>
<BR>
GOLLEM: /cries <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

EQ's The Two Towers: Part Two       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
ON THE BORDERS OF ROHAN <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Their pace has quickened. They must have picked up our scent. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: What?!? Are you on crack? Orcs can't track, n00b. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: STFU dick! I was trying to roleplay! Thanks for ruining the mood! <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Hey, how about a SoW here? Someone forgetting the only guy in the party who can't SoW himself? <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Come on Gimli! Go buy some SoW potions or something! If you can afford that Windblade I am sure you can afford a few SoW potions. <BR>
<BR>
Gimli makes a rude gesture at Legolas. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: I am getting some major lag here - no wonder - look at all those guys on horses! It must be the Riders of Rohan! <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Who are they? <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Uber guild - all barbarian warriors and all own horses. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: An all-warrior guild? What the hell is the purpose of that? <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Wonder what their raids are like - I bet they can't hold aggro worth a damn. Maybe that's how they survive without other classes, huh? No one of them can hold aggro long enough to get killed, he he. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Well at least warriors have more AC than a sheet of cardboard, you treehugging Vulcan wannabe. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Eat me, dorf. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: I have some smoked wood elf - how about I eat that? Probably a relation of yours. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Shut up you guys - let's see if we can get them to help. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /shout Riders of Rohan! What news from the Mark? <BR>
<BR>
EOMER: Hail, Aragorn. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Wait, how do you know my name? <BR>
<BR>
EOMER: It's in big purple letters above your head, genius. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Oh... yeah. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: /em rolls his eyes. <BR>
<BR>
EOMER: All your mobs are belong to us. We are camping this whole zone. So you guys leave. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Who camps a whole zone? Especially when you don't even get experience for most of the mobs? You are such a loser. Get off the computer and do your homework, dweeb. <BR>
<BR>
EOMER: /duel Gimli <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: /duel Eomer <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: OK, OK, no dueling here. We are looking for two of our friends. They skipped our party with all our phat lewt and ran into this zone with a bunch of orcs chasing them. <BR>
<BR>
EOMER: Well, we trained the only other guys in the zone when it was dark. This place is worse than Kithicor at night. I think they all died. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Were there two hobbits with them? Did you see two hobbits? <BR>
<BR>
EOMER: Dude, we ran by them so fast I didn't stop to look at who is in their group. I was on my frickin' horse man. Anyway, the corpses are all over there. Go look for yourself. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Man, for an uber guild you guys are dicks. <BR>
<BR>
EOMER: If we had more zones for people our level we wouldn't have to dick around in these lower zones and train people for fun. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Man, I hope their corpses haven't rotted. <BR>
<BR>
EOMER: Well, maybe they got rezzes. But do not trust to hope. It has forsaken this zone. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: If you're going to talk all stupid you may as well set roleplaying on, dork. <BR>
<BR>
Eomer makes a rude gesture at Gimli. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Hey, check it out - they must have come back to loot their corpses before they got killed again. Look - a trail of little hobbit corpses leading away from the scene of the battle. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Into Fangorn Forest. I hear that's a pretty nasty zone. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: It's one of the oldest zones in the game. Let's head in there and find them. I want my split from the Moria loot. <BR>
<BR>
TO BE CONTINUED<BR>
 <BR>
EQ's The Two Towers: Part Three       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
ON THE EDGE OF FANGORN FOREST <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Nice of those Riders of Rohan dicks to train us. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Man, this sucks. No cleric to rezz us - I actually lost a level we got killed so much. <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: I read on Allakhazam that there's a quest here we can do - we have to go find some named treant. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Cool - let's go find him. <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Hail, Treebeard. <BR>
<BR>
TREEBEARD: Well, harooom-hooom, hello there. Are you an [orc] or are you [something else]? <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: We are something else. <BR>
<BR>
TREEBEARD: Well, sounds like orc mischief to me! <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Oh, bloody hell. Now we're dead. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Would it have been better if we told him we were orcs?? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Hail, Merry. Hail, Pippin. <BR>
<BR>
Gandalf begins to cast a spell. <BR>
Treebeard looks much less aggresive. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Hold on, let me adjust your faction. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Wait, you can do that? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: He, he, he. <BR>
<BR>
YET ANOTHER SHORT WHILE LATER <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Hey, some of these trees are glowering at us dubiously. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: /em tries to look innocent. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: You were killing treants again in South Karana, weren't you? <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Hey, how was I supposed to know that the treants and the ents are on the same faction? <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: I have got something on track called The White Wizard. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: How does it con? <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Red as hell. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Well, let's strike quickly so he can't put a spell on us. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Yeah, right. I could pwn you guys so bad. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: We thought you were dead and your corpse was lost. And since our palie died we had no way to rezz you anyway. How can this be? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: I'm a GM - anything is possible. MUAH HA HA HA HA! <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Anything? How about some horses then? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Sure - hold on. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: OK, there you go. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Hey, wait, where's mine? Don't I get a horse too? <BR>
<BR>
MUCH LATER, AT THE CITY OF EDORAS <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: OK, where is the soulbinder? <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: I need to sell some loot and go to the bank. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Do you guys want to finish this quest or what? <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: What quest? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: The quest to destroy the One Ring, you fucking idiot! <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Hell, I don't even know where Frodo is anymore man. I say we just do our own thing. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Yeah, I think I am going to work on tradeskills a while. Got my alcohol tolerance up to 180. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Alcohol tolerance is not a tradeskill, dweeb. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Dammit, we need to do this! Shut up and follow me. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Will we at least get exp and phat l33t? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: yeah, yeah, yeah, just shut up and follow me. Let me do the talking. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: How often do you get a GM to do your quests for you? He, he, he. <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: Can you do my epic for me too? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Uh, no. <BR>
<BR>
BACK IN FANGORN FOREST <BR>
<BR>
TREEBEARD: My home is at the foot of the mountain. I told Gandalf I will keep you safe, and safe is where I will keep you. Would you care for some [ent-draught]? <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: What is ent-draught? <BR>
<BR>
TREEBEARD: Ent-draught is the miraculous drink that we ents drink to keep us healthy and strong. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Yes, we would like some ent-draught. <BR>
<BR>
TREEBEARD: Would you care to [supersize] your ent-draught? <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Yes, I would like to supersize. <BR>
<BR>
TREEBEARD: Here you go! <BR>
<BR>
Glug, glug, glug. Pippin has drank a supersize ent-draught. <BR>
<BR>
You feel yourself grow taller! <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Hey, what the hell?!? How did you do that? There a shaman around here somewhere? <BR>
<BR>
BACK AT EDORAS <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Hail, Theoden King! <BR>
<BR>
Theoden glowers at you dubiously. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Better do that faction thing again, dude. <BR>
<BR>
Gandalf begins to cast a spell. <BR>
Theoden appears to be less aggressive. <BR>
<BR>
THEODEN: Hail, Gandalf Stormcrow. What the hell do you want? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Ah, hell. I think Saruman must be playing this NPC. He isn't supposed to be saying that. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: I thought Saruman got fired from SOE? <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: No, he didn't, they just gave him a written warning. <BR>
<BR>
GRIMA: This is Saruman - I am two-boxing Grima AND Theoden! Muah ha ha ha! <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Time to use this very special spell - it's a prototype we were using on Test. <BR>
<BR>
Gandalf begins to cast a spell. <BR>
Theoden says "Following you, master." <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: Sweet! it worked! <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: How the hell does a wizard charm anything? I thought you guys just nuked and stuff. <BR>
<BR>
GRIMA: Aw, shit. <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: /pet attack Grima. <BR>
<BR>
Theoden says "I'll teach you to interfere with me Grima!" <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: This game just gets more fucked up all the time.<BR>
 <BR>
The Two Towers: Part Four       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
THE GOLDEN HALL OF MEDUSELD, IN THE CITY OF EDORAS <BR>
<BR>
GANDALF: OK I fixed it so Saruman can't control Theoden anymore. But he changed the password for Grima so I can't do anything about him. That character is such a wuss anyway I figured we would just let him go. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Well, we should probably get out of here. Saruman is going to trigger the Ring War and we don't want to be here for that. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: Cool, I have never been to Thurgadin. Visit my brethren and all that. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Wrong ring war, stupid. I mean the One Ring. I mean the one where 10,000 orcs over level 40 come charging into this zone. <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: So, we should stand and fight! Bring 'em on! <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /em bitch-slaps Gimli for saying something so stupid. <BR>
<BR>
THEODEN: Well, I am the king here and I say we head to the Helm's Deep zone. The fortress there should give us a good advantage over the orcs. Anyone else have any ideas? No? Good. <BR>
<BR>
EOWYN: /tell Aragorn I heard you broke up with your in-game GF. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /reply yeah, she told me she was a 40 year old balding man so I put her on my ignore list, and then found out she lied and was really an 18 year old nympho supermodel. Total bummer. <BR>
<BR>
EOWYN: /tell Aragorn well I am a 21 year old coed - want me to tell you what I'm wearing? <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: Hey guys, I am going to uh, run to the merchant and sell really quick - brb. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /reply so what are you wearing? <BR>
<BR>
DEEP INSIDE FANGORN FOREST <BR>
<BR>
TREEBEARD: Something is going to happen that has not happened in an age - Entmoot. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: What the hell is that? <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Dude check it out - other ents! They are all coming here! I am going to check Allkhazam and see what this quest is all about - brb. <BR>
<BR>
ON THE ROAD TO HELM'S DEEP <BR>
<BR>
GAMLING: Hey, Hama, who is that up ahead? And what the hell is that he's riding? Is that one of those lizard things? <BR>
<BR>
HAMA: I'm not sure. <BR>
<BR>
WARG RIDER: You Rohirrim have ruined your own lands! You'll not ruin mine!! <BR>
<BR>
GAMLING: What the... <BR>
<BR>
HAMA: Oh, a'qpt!!!! <BR>
<BR>
A Warg bashes Hama for 48 points of damage! <BR>
Hama is stunned! <BR>
A Warg bites Hama for 450 points of damage! <BR>
A Warg delivers a critical blow (2562) <BR>
<BR>
Hama has been slain by a Warg! <BR>
<BR>
GAMLING: HOLY mlps!!!! That guys's mount killed Hama!!!! Since when do mounts kill people?!?! <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /shout WARG RIDERS!!!! <BR>
<BR>
THEODEN: Great - thanks man. Now we have several hundred panicking noobs on our hands. Way to go. <BR>
<BR>
EOWYN: OK so I have cloth armor, but I have a really good sword! I can fight! <BR>
<BR>
THEODEN: Uh... tell you what, Eowyn. How about you have show everyone the way to Helm's Deep and Aragorn and I and the rest of the people who have an armor class over 20 fight the warg riders, OK? THat way we don't have to rezz your dumb ass later. ok thx <BR>
<BR>
Eowyn makes a rude gesture at Theoden. <BR>
<BR>
THEODEN: CHARGE!!!! <BR>
<BR>
EOWYN: /shout OK listen up - if you want to follow me to Helm's Deep come on - otherwise stay here and get killed by a thundering herd of warg riders. <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER <BR>
<BR>
THEODEN: Someone tell me, how the hell do you fall of a cliff during a fight? It's not like he was auto-following someone. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /g Hey, can you guys drag my corpse out of the river? <BR>
<BR>
LEGOLAS: /g No way dude we are heading to Helm's Deep. You are SOL. If you are dumb enough to fall of a cliff in the middle of a fight you can get your own damn corpse. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /g how did a little dick like you get in my group anyway? <BR>
<BR>
GIMLI: /g The LFG tool? He, he, he. <BR>
<BR>
ARAGORN: /g fine, I will get myself out of the river. Just know that if I complete this quest you aren't getting shit. <BR>
<BR>
BACK IN FANGORN FOREST <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: OK this is the quest where you get these ents to fight for you - cool! <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: SWEET!!! How do we start it? <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Well, you have to go through this long bit and then they follow you or something. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Well, figure it out so we can do it. <BR>
<BR>
A SHORT WHILE LATER <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: So, Merry, you find out what your supposed to say to get his thing going yet? <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Yeah, it's pretty long so I am printing it out. <BR>
<BR>
PIPPIN: Well, as long as it doesn't take too long. <BR>
<BR>
MERRY: Nah, it shouldn't. Oh, wait, the printer's out of ink. Where did I put that other ink cartridge? <BR>
<BR>
