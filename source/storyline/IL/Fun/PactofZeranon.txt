<br>
The ranger’s even, unhurried footsteps echoed throughout the pristine chapel as he walked toward the altar at the head.  His booted feet meeting the gleaming alabaster tiles on the floor with every step, he furtively gazed out from under the brim of his woodsman’s fedora as if stalking his prey.  Strapped over his shoulder rested a finely crafted Trueshot Bow next to a quiver of arrows.  <br>
<br>
Though obviously a man of nature by his attire, the ranger’s demeanor was more closely compared to that of an assassin.  His face was never seen in the enshrouding shadows of his feathered hat, but the intensity of his gaze was such that it was unmistakable when his eyes were turned your way.  His aspect always calm and collective, it seemed he was never in a hurry to get anywhere.  By all outward indications, this mysterious man would stride calmly from a raging inferno.<br>
<br>
This day was no different.  Making his way slowly down the central isle in the pure, unblemished chapel, the ranger presented no sign of urgency in his solitary procession.  Though this abstruse figure seemed so out-of-place in the midst of such glorious splendor to Erollisi Marr, the contrast of his presence didn’t seem to bother him in the slightest.<br>
<br>
Finally arriving at his destination, he knelt on one knee before the altar with an easy grace.  The folds of his cloak parted to reveal the gleaming silver of a rapier resting at his hip, the palm of his left hand wrapped protectively about its handle.  <br>
<br>
The ranger’s aspect exuded a peculiar reverence.  Not bowing his head or offering supplication, he closed his eyes and whispered fervently his invocation.<br>
<br>
“The light of dawn I accompany in my reprieve of the night.  Thy countenance warms me like rays of the sun.  Beckoned, I answer.  Summoned, I come.  Speak thy wishes to mortal ears, Queen of Love, and enlighten the mind of thy paramour.”<br>
<br>
No sound betrayed the arrival of the goddess to her temple.  No fanfare or drums.  No displays of otherworldly power or blinding light.  The ranger simply knew the goddess had answered his call, feeling Her presence as though She stood before him across the altar.  <br>
<br>
Keeping his eyes tightly shut, She might have genuinely been standing before him, for all he knew.  It would have taken no more effort than simply lifting his eyelids, and the radiant beauty of Erollisi Marr might have been his to behold.  <br>
<br>
But it was not to be.  Instead, the ranger’s eyes remained closed, denying any such possibility from fruition.  Never again would he see Her radiance.  Such was his vow, spoken ages ago.<br>
<br>
When She spoke, the sweet timbre of Her voice swept over him like the fragrance of a lover filling his nostrils.<br>
<br>
“You have my deepest gratitude for answering my call.  I feared my beckoning may go forth without response.”<br>
<br>
“I understand such a call would not be made, were it not one of necessity, Mistress.”<br>
<br>
“It is as you say.  Had I any alternative left in which to act, I would have done so without hesitation and honored your wishes, cherished one.”<br>
<br>
The ranger paused before speaking.<br>
<br>
“I know.”<br>
<br>
“The past remains the past in all things.  I speak now of the future, beloved.  The Cup of Ages has been discovered by the agents of hate, and soon the Pact of Zeranon will be declared by those who seek it.”<br>
<br>
Silently, the ranger’s grip tightened on the sword at his side.<br>
<br>
“Even now, the omens of prophecy have been sent forth by the Mother and the Prince, and their disciples have embarked upon the course of selection.  Before long, the advocates will go forth and fulfill the prophecy decreed centuries ago.<br>
<br>
“Dear one, I fear the conflict of the higher planes may be visited upon the lands of Norrath should the Cup of Ages fall into possession of the avaricious.  You of all mortals know the consequences of unchecked voracity.”<br>
<br>
“I beg to remind you, Mistress, that I am not your disciple,” the ranger’s voice rose above a whisper.  “What is it you petition of me that you deem unsuitable for your own devotees?”<br>
<br>
“The nature of my beloved faithful preclude the task I require,” the voice of the goddess rang sweetly about the chapel.  “Of necessity, the contrivance I intend to set forth would countermand the devout beliefs of those few who know of the prophecy.  In their stead, I ask you to serve for the sake of the gods and every innocent of Norrath.<br>
<br>
“As you say, dearest, you are not my disciple, and free to return to your self-imposed exile.  But you are my beloved by virtue of the past.  I come to you now in earnest need, for myself and all things.  Even you would not escape the unleashed wrath of Zeranon’s Chalice.  The day of the keeper approaches with all expediency.  Soon the sun will rise for the last time on the lands of Norrath and become extinguished in the whispered convergence of power.<br>
<br>
“I beseech you, beloved.  Serve me now with devotion as my trusted agent, if not my disciple, lest all things come to an end.”<br>
<br>
With calm deliberation, the enigmatic ranger lifted his head, eyes fully open.  What met his gaze, he was not prepared to see.<br>
<br>
“I am yours to command, Mistress, as I have always been since the eve of our passion so long ago.  Speak your divine wishes, and I will see it done.”<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 1 - Prophecies Revealed</c><br>
<br>
“You do not know what you ask, child.”  Xon Quexill’s measured tone echoed softly, its calm timbre resounding from the silent walls.<br>
<br>
Dreketh knelt in the midst of the simple guild hall, her eyes fixed to the floor in solemn respect to her master of six years.  Six years – six eternities since he took her under his wing, and inducted her into the company of his necromancers as an initiate.  <br>
<br>
“No, master,” Dreketh whispered.  “I do not.”<br>
<br>
Quite the contrary, Dreketh knew fully well that her request would be the proverbial powder keg to the denizens of the hall.  Nevertheless, for her to contradict the word of her guild master would have been a severe breach of protocol.<br>
<br>
Along the surrounding walls stood the stalwart denizens of the Neriak Hall of the Dead, their taciturn manner more unnerving than any impassioned cry of outrage.  Among their numbers stood a massed assortment of Dark Elf aristocracy including the prominent guild masters of both the necromancers and shadow knights – Xon Quexill and Nezzka Tolax, respectively.<br>
<br>
Master Quexill’s ash-colored eyes narrowed as he looked down upon Dreketh kneeling before him, the tendrils of her hair falling unadorned about her blue-skinned face.  To date, Dreketh had been an exemplary necromancer and protégé.  Considering the circumstances under which she came into his company, her assimilation into the guild was remarkably effortless.  <br>
<br>
Which was why her request to leave his guild and join another came as such an unexpected shock.  Not only was it a thinly veiled declaration of rebellion on her behalf, but the temerity among his membership to make such a request was unprecedented.  Indeed, the mere utterance of Dreketh’s request would have far-reaching political impact on the standing he maintained within the consortium of guilds.  Guild members have been outright executed for less, without trial or quarter.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, Dreketh’s request had been made for all to hear, and the consequences must be dealt with expertly.  Quexill donned an aire of arrogance – a display for those present to focus on.  When he spoke, it was with careful consideration to his words.<br>
<br>
“Such a request is… unusual at best, child.  What has brought about your dissatisfaction of our sect?”<br>
<br>
“No dissatisfaction, master.  I assure you,” Dreketh responded.<br>
<br>
“None?” Quexill raised an eyebrow, a hint of irritation added to his tone.  “None whatsoever?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh shook her head in silence.<br>
<br>
Quexill stole a furtive glance at Nezzka Tolax, standing clad in his full plate armor next to him.  Tolax was always a resolute  and steadfast colleague, this day being no exception.  Unperturbed, the imposing man stood in silence, watching events unfold in his usual manner.  Breaking his granite-like disposition, Master Tolax returned Quexill’s glance with a slight shrug.  Obviously he, too, had no prior knowledge this was coming – no idea that Dreketh desired to become ranked among his knights.<br>
<br>
Quexill returned his attention to his protégé.<br>
<br>
“I find that difficult to believe, child.  Very difficult, indeed.”  Quexill’s domineering tone left nothing to the imagination.  He was confounded by her behavior – even frustrated.  “You hold no contention among the rank and file?  No resentment with your tutors for the constraints placed upon you in your studies?  Nothing regarding the demands, the work, the devotion?<br>
<br>
Quexill placed his hands upon his own chest, in a gesture of self-martyrdom.  “Nothing I have done to turn you away from our comradeship?”<br>
<br>
Having reached a peak in his dramatic display of chastising this upstart for the benefit of those present, he paused.  The silence was a deafening roar to Dreketh’s ears.  Understanding that his question was rhetorical, she made no effort to answer.  Consequently, every muted second that passed seemed an eternity.  Feeling every eye in the hall focused on her, she fervently wished he would continue his tirade and shroud her humiliation with the sound of his voice.<br>
<br>
Mercifully, Master Quexill resumed.<br>
<br>
“I remember the enthusiasm with which you met your induction into the necromancer’s guild, Dreketh.  Barring a few minor initial occurrences, your performance has been outstanding.  You have met the requirements for your studies with equanimity.  Your field performance has well been above reproach.  From all indications, you have fulfilled all that is demanded your station and more.  These are not the qualities of one who desires an end to her service.”<br>
<br>
Maintaining her harrowed silence, Dreketh slowly nodded her head, eyes kept firmly to the floor on which she knelt.<br>
<br>
“Yet here you are,” Quexill sniffed.  Pausing, he calculated his next move – tried to devise a politic means to handle the situation without losing face too drastically in the eyes of his peers.  At length, he tilted his head to one side and leaned forward near Dreketh’s obeisant form.<br>
<br>
“Look into my eyes, child.”<br>
<br>
Obediently, Dreketh raised her face and stared into the intense gaze of her mentor.  It was worse than she had imagined.  With a single glance, she saw within his eyes the conundrum of puzzlement and worry he was experiencing at having his prized pupil show, for all to see, that she wishes to turn her back on him and all he stands for.  <br>
<br>
Detecting, too, a hint of hurt in his gaze, Dreketh realized it also went much deeper.  Xon Quexill had gone so far as to personally nurture her development – not just in the art of necromancy, but as a young Teir’Dal woman.  The loss of both her parents in the Battle of Butchers left Dreketh without sponsor at the early age of adolescence.  It was Tolax, in fact, who petitioned Quexill on her behalf to accept her into the necromancer’s guild two years prematurely of the requisite age.  As guild master and military commander to her late parents, it was his personal request that provided her sponsorship for survival in Teir’Dal society. <br>
<br>
Demanding no added recompense, Master Quexill took it upon himself to single-handedly supplant her absent parents and teach her the ways of Innoruuk.  He taught her how survival meant domination over one’s enemies, how the path to domination was victory, how victory was achieved through hatred, and how hatred was the path of Innoruuk – Prince of Hate, wellspawn and creator of the Dark Elves.  <br>
<br>
He was her mentor, teacher, spiritual guide and friend.  He was her truest father in spirit, if not in fact.<br>
<br>
“Why have you asked this of me?” Quexill spoke with an audible whisper, his words rimmed with outrage and disbelief.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s already intimidated gaze froze in place, her expression pleading.  The vision of her guild master’s striking features blurred, her eyes quickly filling with tears.  <br>
<br>
Quexill’s disapproving face loomed closer as he lowered his imposing form to one knee.  Assertively, he reached out to cup Dreketh’s supple jaw in his hand.<br>
<br>
“Why?” he whispered again, this time softly enough so only she could hear him.<br>
<br>
She winced as though he’d shrieked the word at her in heated rebuke.  Paralyzed in fear of his fury, the tendons in Dreketh’s throat constricted as she struggled to bite her tongue.  She wanted desperately to cry out the answer for all to hear, yet was compelled by forces beyond her power to remain silent.  <br>
<br>
Trembling in her master’s caress, Dreketh’s brow furrowed as she closed her eyes painfully, unable to look at her master any longer.  Because of her refusal to answer, she knew what was inevitably to come next.  Yet the pain of his gaze hurt more by far.  A tear escaped her control, spilling down her blue cheek and onto her master’s unrelenting hand.<br>
<br>
Quexill’s expression remained stone cold.  Not a twitch betrayed any inner emotion as he let loose his power into his reticent child.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s world exploded in an eruption of searing pain coursing through her entire body.  Through it, she felt the strength in her limbs weaken.  Her skin felt as though it crawled over sinew – a sensation much like a water skin whose contents are spilling to the floor.  The normally quiet hallways throughout the Lodge of the Dead reverberated with Dreketh’s agonized screams.  The denizens calmly observed, their forms silent and monolithic as Quexill’s spell bored into her very soul and sapped her life’s energy in a slow and tormenting remise. <br>
<br>
It is the art of the necromancer to manipulate pure life energy as an artisan manipulates clay.  The feared and reviled art encompasses many ways of tapping into such energies and controlling them.  Among these techniques is ranked the vilest, yet most widely used spell that every necromancer learns from the earliest stages of their talent: the vampiric draining of another’s energies into one’s own self.  The process is excruciating as the victim’s essence is brutally stripped from their body – their life’s force ruthlessly stolen as they remain powerless to retain it.  This tapping into one’s soul is a rape the likes of which no other perversity could surmount. For many, it remains the primary source for so much repugnance of its practitioners.<br>
<br>
As guild master, Quexill was a proficient at this ability.  Methodically, he stripped Dreketh of her energy.  He could feel her taut jaw muscles in his grasp as she continued her incessant cries.  He could feel her tremble violently as wave after wave of suffering engulfed her.  Through his arm, he could feel the influx of her energy entering his own body, enhancing his already formidable might.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh’s life was held literally in the palm of Quexill’s hand.  Had he wished it, he could have ended her existence there and then, and the entire matter would have been considered settled by all.  His contemplation brought him dangerously close to doing just that.  His standing as guild master would remain unaffected.  Teir’Dal law gave him the right to destroy her for such impertinence.  A portion of him would even receive a certain amount of grim satisfaction in delivering her due for so maliciously turning on him, as she had.<br>
<br>
Before he was given the liberty of fully deciding her fate, a voice rang clearly over the din throughout the hall – a voice which clearly did not belong to one of the familiar denizens.<br>
<br>
“Stop!”<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill immediately dropped his attention to his pupil’s torment and whirled about to meet the new threat of an intruder within the sanctum.  Dreketh’s body fell to the floor in a limp and seemingly lifeless heap, her magenta robes settling about her lithe form.  In one fluid motion, Quexill raised his hand, palm outward, poised to unleash a magical attack.  In a single heartbeat, this newfound threat would be reduced to a quivering mass of flesh.<br>
<br>
His enraged vision clearing, a flash of recognition crossed Quexill’s face as he caught a glimpse of the trespasser he was about to dispatch.  Immediately, he checked his spell.  Clasping his hand firmly into a tight fist, he drew it to his own chest, clenching it rigidly as if to suppress a tremendous force from being unleashed.<br>
<br>
Standing in the archway was an aged man dressed in dull gray robes, his hands hidden within the sleeves.  His blue skin shown ashen, revealing his advanced years.  His hair was a healthy white, cascading to his shoulders in unkempt masses overshadowing his face.  From within the natural cowl shown the cool glimmering of the man’s eyes, each framed by an assortment of crags and wrinkles.  More disconcerting was the calm with which he faced Master Quexill, seemingly undaunted about facing any threat this master of the necromantic arts may pose.<br>
<br>
Quexill remained on one knee above Dreketh’s inert form, his face a display of malevolence.  He scowled darkly at the gray-robed figure as it stepped forward, entering the muted light of the hall. <br>
<br>
“Cease now, Xon Quexill, or we shall all suffer consequences of abysmal proportion,” the old man’s quivering voice spoke.<br>
<br>
The light of the hall revealed the robed man’s eyes to be clouded over in blindness.  Though typically no Dark Elf would be allowed the privilege of survival with such a debilitating malady, Quexill knew this particular Dark Elf was anything but typical.<br>
<br>
He was Kella N’Threk, priest of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
“You are not a denizen of The Dead.  By what authority do you enter this sanctum?”  Quexill stood upright slowly, his face a mask of incensed, but calm vigilance.<br>
<br>
“I arrive by no lesser authority than Tal’Shyen.  I invoke Innoruuk’s name and speak with His tongue.”<br>
<br>
For the first time, the hall’s occupants stirred.<br>
<br>
Tal’Shyen was the highest prerogative of Innoruuk’s priesthood by which their authority is stated.  Once declared, the word of the priest or priestess was to be considered as though spoken by the Prince of Hate Himself.  For a priest to declare Tal’Shyen was a profound occurrence, reserved for times of deified prophecy or indoctrination, and only directly from the mouth of the priest who received such revelation.  Tal’Shyen ascended the priest even above that of high sovereign, and transcended any mortal law – including guild statutes of autonomy.<br>
<br>
It was commonly rumored among the Neriak populace that, in his youth over three hundred years ago, Kella N’Threk went on fast and prayed to Innoruuk for two consecutive months.  Eating only purified saprophyte and water, it is rumored he prayed ceaselessly day and night to posses the wisdom of a god.  After a display of such devotion, he was granted an answer to his prayers and given a glimpse into the mind of Innoruuk.  Once his mortal mind saw and understood that which only the gods may comprehend, his mind was instantly driven insane by such cognition – his eyes blinded by such countenance.<br>
<br>
Of course, Quexill knew of Kella N’Threk and his history.  He knew of his affliction and the rumored rationale surrounding his survival when any other Teir’Dal would have been mercifully executed after such an ordeal.  Word had it that the conclave of priests refused to destroy a soul that had possibly seen into the mind of the Prince of Hate, claiming that to do so would be reckless, considering what insight they would be sacrificing.<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill didn’t believe a word of it.<br>
<br>
This did not negate the fact that Kella N’Threk was still a priest of Innoruuk – one of the spiritual leaders of the Teir’Dal.  Mad as he may be, his authority had been stated and sanctioned by the cleric’s guild.  Should Quexill decide to censure this authority, it would have profound repercussions should N’Threk’s declaration be genuine in the eyes and mind of Innoruuk.  Ironically, the master necromancer found himself facing the same dilemma the conclave faced so many years before.<br>
<br>
Quexill once again looked askance to Tolax, silently seeking counsel.  Tolax shook his head slowly, his expression one of calm prudence in the face of these events.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Tolax is right, Quexill mused silently.  So be it.  He would play N’Threk’s game for the time being.  He altered his expression to one of affability as he turned back to confront the priest.<br>
<br>
“Very well,” he said.  “Enter and welcome, priest of Innoruuk.  We are honored by your presence, and the Presence you bring with you.”<br>
<br>
The entire hall bowed graciously, paying a short-lived, but sincere homage to their spiritual leader.<br>
<br>
“I come to speak on behalf of your protégé, Xon Quexill.  In private counsel I will speak my words to your ears and no other.”<br>
<br>
The blind priest’s condescension was agitating.  By his own standards, Quexill considered himself a tolerant man.  Nevertheless, for an outsider – priest or no – to enter his domain and begin making demands in this manner was presumptuous.  The fact that it was N’Threk made the situation even more precarious.<br>
<br>
The master necromancer bit back his instinctive retort.<br>
<br>
“Most… certainly.”  Quexill bowed once again in a tremendous show of restraint for the benefit of those present.  He raised his voice to address the hall.  “We will adjourn for the meantime and reconvene at the hour of whispers.”<br>
<br>
The denizens began to shuffle their way from the hall as quietly as can be expected after such events.  During this transitional time, Nezzka Tolax stole the opportunity and approached Xon Quexill.  Placing a hand upon his colleague’s shoulder, he leaned in to whisper confidentially.<br>
<br>
“The old fool is mad, my friend.  The gods only know what he is capable of.  Are you certain you wish to be alone with him?”<br>
<br>
Quexill eyed N’Threk warily, sizing up the situation as those clouded eyes stared unerringly in his direction.  The old priest stood resolute as the denizens exited the hall around him.<br>
<br>
“He is many things, knight, but a threat he is not.  If he speaks with Innoruuk’s tongue, it is in the best interest for me to hear what he has to say.  If not, then he is merely a delusional old man worthy of our contempt and pity.  He may be deserving of wariness, certainly, but not fear.  I will handle things well enough.”<br>
<br>
Tolax nodded his reluctant assent.  Turning, he marched toward the exit behind N’Threk, glancing a meaningful look at the priest’s undiscerning face as he passed.  The metallic clang of his footfalls echoed down the hallway outside, leaving Quexill alone with the priest in the Hall of the Dead.  Dreketh’s still form lay on the floor, apparently forgotten by all.<br>
<br>
“We are alone.”  Quexill’s firm voice broke the silence.<br>
<br>
“No,” N’Threk responded.  “We are not alone.  No longer shall we be.  Innoruuk’s divine presence remains over us here – over all Neriak.  For we have been given a new dispensation from the divine Prince of Hate.”<br>
<br>
Quexill stood, staring at the priest, unmoved by his words.  N’Threk continued, undaunted.<br>
<br>
“By His hand, we are about to enter into a new age.  His age.  And by our allegiance to His name, it is to be our age as well.  At long last, the Teir’Dal shall ascend to their rightful legacy on the lands of Norrath!”<br>
<br>
Quexill continued staring, his face expressionless.<br>
<br>
“Do you not understand my words?”  N’Threk strode forward urgently, bothered by Quexill’s lack of fervent emotion.  “Or has your work with the dead made you daft as the cavorting bones you beguile?”<br>
<br>
“Cease your drivel, and speak of something substantial, priest.  Perhaps then you will receive the response you seek.”<br>
<br>
N’Threk pursed his lips in a stylized scowl.  With a flourish, he pointed to Dreketh’s unconscious form lying on the floor nearby.<br>
<br>
“This is a matter of substance, guild master!”<br>
<br>
“Oh?” Quexill glanced down at Dreketh offhandedly, his tone as close to mockery as it could be without turning blasphemous.  “And how may that be?”<br>
<br>
“Fool!”  N’Threk’s quivering voice rang sharply.  “Before you lies the instrument of the future – the vessel through which comes the very deliverance of Teir’Dal destiny, and here you stand before it more blind than I!”<br>
<br>
Quexill’s expression turned dire, but he remained silent as the priest continued.<br>
<br>
“Have we as a people lost our way so hopelessly so as not to see the truth of things?  Have you, Xon Quexill, become so prideful with your eyes sighted upon the heavens that you become tripped upon the very thing you seek, as it lies prone at your feet?<br>
<br>
“I may be a blind old madman, but I do recognize the works of Innoruuk when they are about me.  And you… Can you, with your perfect vision, see it?  I think not.”<br>
<br>
“Speak plainly, old man.”  Xon Quexill had had enough of being mocked in his own guild hall by this daft fool.  “Or I will personally escort you back to the feet of your master and renounce you for invoking Tal’Shyen needlessly, without representation.”<br>
<br>
N’Threk closed his mouth abruptly, his nostrils flaring.  For a priest to invoke Tal’Shyen without the true authority of Innoruuk was the height of mortal sin.  If renounced, the priest is stripped naked and slowly tortured in public for days until death finally claimed him. <br>
<br>
Stepping forward, N’Threk stood within a hand’s breadth of Quexill’s face.<br>
<br>
“You are witness to a nexus, Xon Quexill,” N’Threk said in a soft, rasping voice.<br>
<br>
“If such were the truth, a high sovereign would be sitting in judgement on the monarchy,” was Quexill’s evenhanded reply.  “A high sovereign has not ruled the Teir’Dal in over fifteen centuries.”<br>
<br>
“Nor will it ever again be so until we have redeemed our ways in the eyes of the Prince.”<br>
<br>
“The Teir’Dal will never fall from grace, old man.”<br>
<br>
“That…!”  N’Threk brought an index finger before the guild master’s face, quivering with ardent rage.  The old man’s serious face slowly transformed into a grin of irony.  Few other times has N’Threk appeared more maniacal.  “That… is precisely why there will be no high sovereign in our day.  That arrogant, prevailing sentiment that we are untouchable.”<br>
<br>
“That does not negate the truth.  There can be no nexus born to us without a high sovereign.”<br>
<br>
The priest’s voice echoed through the hall.  “It is the truth because there was no birth of a nexus!”  <br>
<br>
“You speak nonsense, old man!”  Quexill raised his arms in exasperation.  “How can a nexus exist without having been born?”<br>
<br>
“You do not understand!”  N’Threk pointed to Dreketh again in his tirade.  “She is one part of the nexus, the other half of her destiny lies beyond!”<br>
<br>
Quexill looked at the priest incredulously as he whispered.  “A nexus is born through Immaculate Conception by divine power granted of the high sovereign.  Everyone knows that!  It is one person!”<br>
<br>
N’Threk sighed, downcast.  His disposition switched instantly from irate to sullen as he turned away.<br>
<br>
“No, you have no notion of what a nexus truly is,” he said, throwing an arm up in dismissal.  “And the others are no more knowledgeable than you, with their noses buried in ancient tomes and withering scrolls.  I am about the here and now.”<br>
<br>
Nonplussed, Quexill watched the old priest as he made his way across the hall toward one of the benches lining the walls.  Reaching out an unsteady hand, he probed the air before him for a suitable berth.  <br>
<br>
Unwittingly, the master necromancer stepped forward and guided N’Threk down into a wooden chair near the entrance.  The old priest’s sudden reprieve from fury made him regret his earlier tone.  N’Threk may be mad, but he was still Quexill’s elder, and deserving of at least some token respect.  Sitting on a nearby bench, Quexill looked at the priest expectantly for an explanation.<br>
<br>
Blinking habitually from the days of his former sight, the priest collected his thoughts before speaking.<br>
<br>
“Listen to me, necromancer.  We are entering into great and terrible times.  Innoruuk has granted us a boon by which we may ascend over our enemies for all time. Understand the repercussions of what I am saying when I tell you that Innoruuk has invoked prophecy, and is acting upon it even now.”<br>
<br>
The obvious skepticism on Quexill’s face was apparent even to the blind priest.<br>
<br>
“Prophecy, necromancer.”  N’Threk nodded emphatically, as if to reaffirm his own words.<br>
<br>
“What prophecy?”  Quexill’s voice was fraught with doubt.<br>
<br>
The priest glanced over his shoulder, as if somehow he could see any eavesdroppers about.  Leaning in closely to the necromancer, Kella N’Threk whispered in a soft, raspy voice.<br>
<br>
“The Chalice.”<br>
<br>
“What chalice?” Quexill asked with a small shrug.<br>
<br>
N’Threk shook his head in disbelief.  How could he not know?<br>
<br>
“The Chalice!”<br>
<br>
“You’re not speaking about the Chalice of Zeranon…”<br>
<br>
“Oh yes.”  N’Threk nodded emphatically.<br>
<br>
Quexill’s expression turned from one of skepticism to plain disbelief.  Any reservations he held about the priest’s insanity were quelled.  Something had to be done, and quickly before this crazy old man’s rumors started to work their way to paranoid ears.  Quexill reached out and took the priest by the arm, fully intending to take him back to his isolated chambers in the Temple of Innoruuk where he belonged.<br>
<br>
“You step far beyond your boundaries, old fool.  Far, far beyond–“<br>
<br>
N’Threk stood bolt upright.<br>
<br>
“The Prince of Hate will not be mocked!”<br>
<br>
The priest’s words resounded throughout the empty hall with such jarring force that Quexill was thrown off his bench, collapsing to a half-crouch on the floor near the oblivious Dreketh.<br>
<br>
Kella N’Threk, priest of Innoruuk, stood tall, his form towering over the now forcibly prostrate necromancer.  No longer was he an aged, hunched and shuffling priest, but a strong and virile cleric wielding the awesome power of his god.  When he spoke, his voice echoed arduously in Quexill’s mind.<br>
<br>
“Heed you now the words of prophecy, and tremble in the fire of Innoruuk’s hate, mortal! The tears of the slayer upon the brow of the slain shall herald the unsealing of the Cup of Ages.  Sundered light and shadow will be cast upon mortal soil, wielded in the hand of innocence.  And the whispered convergence of power will reign unleashed upon all lands of Norrath by privilege of its keeper.”<br>
<br>
Innoruuk’s raw and unholy hatred flowed through Xon Quexill like a spectre.  N’Threk’s radiance shown like a beacon in the Hall of the Dead, his unkempt hair floating about him by an unseen wind.  Reaching forth a gnarled hand, he placed his palm against the necromancer’s forehead.<br>
<br>
“See, Xon Quexill, and bear witness in your trembling silence!”<br>
<br>
Quexill’s mind exploded in a frantic vision of light and sound.  Within moments he saw in his mind’s eye the enormity of all that was to happen, all that Innoruuk planned, and how Dreketh was the key to the Teir’Dal’s ascension over every other race in Norrath.  He saw endless possibilities and consequences, mingled with visions of war, fire, and blood spreading like a scourge born of supreme hatred.  The vision was horrifying and seductive all at once, and Xon Quexill could not deny it was truly given of the Prince of Hate.<br>
<br>
N’Threk released his hold, causing the necromancer to drop.  Falling forward on his hands and knees, Quexill gasped for breath like a man half-drown as the old priest returned to his former debilitated state, his hair resting about his stooped shoulders.<br>
<br>
Quexill reached up with one hand and grasped at his own dry, rasping throat.<br>
<br>
“No,” he croaked.<br>
<br>
“Yes.”  N’Threk’s  voice left no room for argument.<br>
<br>
“No!”  Quexill’s face upturned to glare at the priest standing above him.  “She is not the one you seek!”<br>
<br>
“The selection has already been made.”<br>
<br>
Quexill struggled to regain his feet, sneering his contempt.  His breath escaping through clenched teeth, the master necromancer advanced on the indifferent priest.<br>
<br>
“Who made the selection?” he asked.<br>
<br>
N’Threk pursed his lips noncommitally.<br>
<br>
“Who!”  Quexill shouted, his own voice an imitation of the priest’s former ire.<br>
<br>
“The arbiter’s identity is not relevant.  The selection is made.”  N’Threk turned his back on the irate guild master.<br>
<br>
“You cowardly bastard…”<br>
<br>
“You disappoint me, necromancer,” N’Threk spat the words over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“I do not exist for your approval or that of your conclave.  My only concern is for my student.”<br>
<br>
N’Threk held up a correcting hand.<br>
<br>
“Former student.  She is no longer yours.  Nezzka Tolax will now oversee her studies as a shadow knight, effective immediately.  Disobey under pain of Hate’s divine vengeance.”<br>
<br>
Quexill looked down at his protégé sullenly.  Dreketh was as close to a daughter as he would ever have.  No other could have hurt him so deeply as she had earlier – or so he had thought at the time.  Knowing now her involuntary motivations was of little comfort to him.  He was losing someone he had allowed himself to care a great deal for – something no Dark Elf did easily, as it left them open to vulnerability.  Now Quexill knew why this was so, in its most cruel sense.<br>
<br>
“I will see to the arrangements,” was his leaden response.  He’d be damned to the judgement of Cazic Thule before he allowed the priest to share in his anguish.<br>
<br>
“See that you do,” N’Threk spoke meaningfully.  <br>
<br>
Having said his peace, the priest turned to take his leave of the Hall of the Dead when Quexill reached out and grasped the shoulder of the man’s coarse, gray robes, halting him mid-stride.<br>
<br>
“Your unannounced visit was foolish, old man,” Quexill said.  “What would you have done had I not seized my power in time?”<br>
<br>
Kella N’Threk turned his head slowly to peer straight into Xon Quexill’s face, giving the master necromancer an uncanny impression of sight within the two cloudy eyes.<br>
<br>
“I would have died,” he said flatly.  “And had I one ounce of breath left within me… I would have thanked you.”<br>
<br>
Dismissing Quexill’s hand from his robe, N’Threk walked grimly through the archway, his shuffling footsteps echoing softly about the hall.<br>
<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 2 - Innocence</c><br>
<br>
“Stop it!” was all Laera could wail before the cruel deluge overtook her.  Everything around her melted in a wave of distorted color and the muffled sounds of cruel laughter ringing in her ears.  Reality was fast becoming a distant memory as her assailant maliciously stole away her senses.<br>
<br>
She opened her mouth to scream, but all that came forth were inaudible gurgling sounds she knew would be impossible for any likely hero to hear.  Before long, all would most certainly be lost unless Rigel came through and saved the day.  <br>
<br>
Dear Rigel.  His mission was a dangerous one, but pivotal.  Would he return in time?<br>
<br>
Laera tried desperately to counter the attack with her own meager powers, but to no avail.  Wave after wave surged over her, tossing her about like a sodden rag doll.  Her sense of direction waned as up and down become distorted concepts.  Unable to withstand the skirmish, she ceased her impotent retaliation.  Her tutors taught her repeatedly that once triumph was no longer viable, survival must become the one focus of your efforts.  Failing that, defeat turns to death.<br>
<br>
She began the struggle in a panicked frenzy to escape her fate.  Tossing about and gasping for the sweet breath of life, Laera’s vision cleared just enough to see Rigel appear high upon a cliff and leap into action.  <br>
<br>
With a great battle cry, her savior hefted the enormous tub of icy cold water, mightily dumping it over her accoster’s pallid little pointy-eared head.  The smug grin of victory on that detestable face disappeared as stunned realization clouded his features.  His shocked expression shown for a glimpse before the frigid waterfall engulfed him.<br>
<br>
“Woo!”  Laera let loose her cheer of victory, raising both fists high above her head.  “Way to go, Rigel!”<br>
<br>
Laughing boisterously, Rigel tossed the empty tub aside, watching his prey flounder in the fishing pond below.  Leaning out past the edge of the grassy cliff, he cupped his mouth as he yelled.<br>
<br>
“High Elves like you reek of Troll pits, Jerrin!”<br>
<br>
With that, Rigel leaped from the cliff and splashed into the crystal clear pond, the ensuing droplets sparkling brilliantly in the noon day sunlight.  Swimming below the surface, he took advantage of the enemy’s confusion by viciously divesting the evil Jerrin of his swimming trunks.<br>
<br>
Laera tossed her head back and laughed out loud, merrily reveling in her long-awaited victory.  Every year when she and her fellow druid acolytes came to visit Felwithe, that annoying High Elf Jerrin would take every opportunity to harass her.  She’d sworn she would see vengeance before she graduated into a full druid.  Now that she had it, she savored it for all it was worth.<br>
<br>
 Raising her fingers to her lips, Laera let out a taunting whistle at her shivering nemesis in the water across the way.<br>
<br>
“Show it off, Jerrin!  Woo!”<br>
<br>
Joining her whistles were the cries of all the other students, both High Elf and Wood Elf – male and female, who happened to be taking advantage of the warm summer day at the fishing pond. <br>
<br>
The young, fair-skinned paladin-to-be blushed a bright shade of red, both attempting to cover himself and tread water at the same time.  Not being particularly successful at either, he looked to Laera of bearing a striking resemblance to a deranged jellyfish who’d spent too much time in the sun.<br>
<br>
From beneath the water, Rigel swam expertly up behind Laera.  Surfacing, he secretly slipped the ill-gotten apparel into her hands.<br>
<br>
“Hold on to these,” he whispered into her ear before disappearing into the water again.<br>
<br>
Recognizing a cue when she heard one, Laera deftly hid her prize behind her back as she watched the floundering High Elf.<br>
<br>
“You-!  Where is…give it back!”  The frantic Jerrin splashed around, looking for the perpetrator.  Catching sight of Rigel surfacing near the edge of the pond, he splashed angrily in that general direction.  “Hey woodie!  You’re orc bait if you don’t give it back!”<br>
<br>
“Huh?”  Rigel cupped a hand up next to his pointed ear, a mischievous smile gracing his boyish features.  “Stop splashing so much, I can’t hear a thing you-“<br>
<br>
“I mean it, woodie!  Now!”<br>
<br>
Climbing up on to shore, Rigel raised both hands in a shrug, showing they were completely empty.<br>
<br>
“You… where is it!”  Jerrin sputtered furiously in his struggle to stay afloat with one arm.<br>
<br>
Grinning smugly, Rigel pointed down into the depths of the pond.<br>
<br>
Cursing an oath, Jerrin dove below in search of his clothing, but not without his stark white posterior bobbing to the surface briefly.  Once again, the growing crowd of onlookers roared to life in a cacophony of  jeers and whistles.<br>
<br>
Laera covered her mouth, her shoulders quivering with laughter.  This was even better than she’d imagined. <br>
<br>
She cast her mind back to all the times he’d gotten the best of her in past visits to Felwithe.  She remembered the time she’d awakened to discover a dead lizard dangling from her bedpost, inches from her face.  She remembered the salt-saturated lunches of hers he’d sabotaged.  Most of all, she remembered the time she’d been bathing alone to discover the smell of smoke pervading the wash house. Hearing a voice yell “fire” from outside, her embarrassment was assured once she ran outside in the buff to find Jerrin and his fellow paladin students waiting for her inevitable display.  What were once bitter memories now served to feed the succulent flames of her revenge.<br>
<br>
Tearing herself away from the spectacle, Laera swam across the pond to the shore where Rigel stood toweling himself off.  Seeing her approach, Rigel ceased his rigorous task and opened his arms out, appealing to her judgement.<br>
<br>
“Well, how did I do?”<br>
<br>
“Outstanding!”  Laera’s face was alight with glee.<br>
<br>
Grinning a crooked smile, Rigel reached out his hand to help her climb out of the pond.  With a rush of water, she was standing next to him on the grass-laden shore, merrily watching a distraught Jerrin play a futile game of Bobbing for Swimwear some distance out.  They snickered quietly together as they overheard him make the occasional hapless plea for help from his surrounding tormentors.<br>
<br>
Rigel tilted his head close to Laera to ask his question in confidence.  “So, where is it?”<br>
<br>
“Oh…”  Laera busied herself with the back of her one-piece swimsuit, extracting Jerrin’s trunks from beneath the forest green folds.  Dangling it in midair, she winked and tossed it behind a boulder, well away from the pond’s edge.<br>
<br>
Rigel pursed his lips in a silent whistle of appreciation.  Sooner or later Jerrin would have to come out of the pond with little or no chance of escaping unscathed.<br>
<br>
“If I’ve ever done anything in the past to upset you – anything at all…” Rigel began to chuckle in spite of himself, “I humbly beg your forgiveness.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, you’d already know if you had,” Laera smiled her response wickedly.  “Trust me.”<br>
<br>
Shaking his head with a grin, Rigel tossed her a dry towel from a nearby stack.  Laera nimbly caught the towel mid-flight, and turned back to the scene as she began to dry herself.<br>
<br>
Her attention diverted, Rigel was afforded the chance to admire her physique.  Her innocuous actions caught his eye, and he couldn’t help but watch as she went through the motions of toweling herself off.  The glistening droplets of water as they ran in rivulets down her unblemished chestnut tan skin.  The fall of her wet auburn hair as she ran her fingers through it, airing the strands to dry.  Her sleek, athletic form as she sat to draw the towel down her legs vigorously.<br>
<br>
Rigel looked away, self-consciously.  He was doing it again.  Why couldn’t he seem to keep things in perspective?  <br>
<br>
Rebuking himself silently, he focused on reality.  He’d been her friend for several months now.  When he first arrived at the school, she’d helped him make the difficult adjustment in separating from his family for the first time.  They’d studied together, played together, and prayed together.  During that entire time, she’d never made any pretense of affection for him – at least, not in that special way.  Besides, she was four years his elder.  In every sense of the word, she was simply his friend.<br>
<br>
“But what a friend,” he muttered to himself.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry?”  Laera had turned back to face him, distractedly trying to clear water out of her ear.<br>
<br>
Rigel started at the unexpected sound of her voice.  Hurriedly, he covered for his slip.<br>
<br>
“B-but will it end?”<br>
<br>
Laera squinted, not understanding.  Pulling her legs up, she switched to a cross-legged seat, her expression questioning.<br>
<br>
Rigel jutted his chin out at the distraught High Elf, still searching the pond for his essential belongings.<br>
<br>
“Jerrin,” he said, conversationally.  “Think this is the end?”<br>
<br>
“It has to be,” she shrugged.  “I’m leaving come autumn.”<br>
<br>
Rigel frowned inwardly.  He hated being reminded of that impending day of her graduation.  She was leaving to fulfill Tunare’s work in the world, and he still had four long years of lonesome drudgery to endure before he’d be free.  Whenever he voiced that anguished fact, she’d always nudge him on the shoulder and say he’d make plenty of new friends in the years to come.  Maybe so, he thought, but nobody could replace her.<br>
<br>
Not ever.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, this would be the last day he had to be with her like this.  In the next few weeks she’d be so busy with trials and exams and prayer that he’d scarcely be seeing her at all. <br>
<br>
Even more significant, for months Rigel had been trying to summon up enough courage to let his feelings show and perhaps kiss Laera for the first time.  His heart stuck in his throat as he realized that if he was ever going to do it, it was going to have to be tonight.  Not tomorrow – tonight!  He didn’t think he had the nerve to do it tonight.  But if he let the day slip away without at least trying, he’d never get another chance.  Surely the moment she stepped out of the school and into the real world, she’d discover some dashing ranger who would sweep her off her feet.  All this considered, the next four years being locked away at the school were going to be an eternity and Rigel would never know if…<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if he made his move and she turned him away, their friendship would never be the same.  It would be impossible.  She would deny it, he was sure, saying that they could still be friends, but it would still be different.  Very different.  Above all else, he wanted her as a friend forever, and was loath to place their relationship in jeopardy by acting on what she may consider to be some foolish, puerile crush.<br>
<br>
Sighing heavily, Rigel sat on the lush grass next to his friend.<br>
<br>
“Hey, what is it?” Laera asked, working the towel in a frenzy over her half-dry hair.  “You’re not worried about tonight, are you?”<br>
<br>
Rigel half-turned his head, his brow creased in confusion.  What was she saying?  Could it be she was reading his thoughts?  Tonight?  What?<br>
<br>
“If you are, I think you can relax,” she continued, casually.  “After what just happened, Jerrin doesn’t have the stones to pull anything on me so soon.  In fact, I doubt he can even find them after the attack of the ice man…”  Her voice trailing off, she nudged him in that familiar way.<br>
<br>
Outwardly, Rigel smirked at Laera’s shameless innuendo.  Inwardly he was banging his head against the ground, telling himself to get his mind out of the clouds and straight with the conversation.<br>
<br>
“Right,” he said, nodding.<br>
<br>
“Besides,” Laera tossed the towel to rest around the back of her neck.  Leaning forward, she placed her elbows on her knees.  “I’m sure there’s a hero out there who would defend me, should the need arise.”<br>
<br>
Rigel mimicked a wince, drawing a breath through his clenched teeth in a pretend gasp.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” he said.  “After today, I think a hero may cramp your style.”<br>
<br>
Laera shoved him with pretentious gall.<br>
<br>
“In fact,” Rigel continued, undaunted in his flippancy, “I’d say you might scare him away for fear he’d set you off and you’d get someone to pants him in front of the whole-“  He never finished his sentence due to the barrage of playful slaps he had to defend himself against from his friend.<br>
<br>
The two young Wood Elves fought their heated battle in a montage of  swing and parry.  The sunlight shown brightly in the cloudless sky above them, its warming rays like a blessing from Tunare Herself.  It was as if somehow the Mother of All were smiling upon her children below, reveling in their joy and laughter one final time before they passed into adulthood.<br>
<br>
A good number of the students enjoying the cool, rippling waters that day were in the twilight of their youth, soon to become full druids and rangers, paladins and spell casters.  They were to be the newest ranks of Tunare’s Army of Life very shortly – all too shortly – laden with the responsibilities and duties accorded their titles.  <br>
<br>
It was a common saying – particularly among the elder races whose longevity could be measured well into centuries – that youth is wasted on the young.  Such a thing implied that children naturally took their youth for granted.  Put another way, one had to let go of their youth in order to fully appreciate it.  Those who espoused such ideals were often dubbed as cynics by their youthful and exuberant offspring.  Even so, the saying lived on through the ages, comparing imminent adulthood to the looming of a shadow which masked out the light of innocence, never to be lifted again.<br>
<br>
A shadow passed over Laera.<br>
<br>
Her roughhousing with Rigel came to an abrupt end as she turned to see who stood over her, blocking the sunlight.  Shading her eyes, she recognized the silhouette as one of the druid messengers.<br>
<br>
“Acolyte Nellynwae, Head Mistress Netheel extends Tunare’s blessing and requests your presence at Her temple without delay.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Laera bit her lip as her bare feet met the cold steps leading down into the entrance to the Temple of Tunare.  Shivers ran up her spine.  Looking above, she scowled at the ornate marble architecture towering over her, blocking the blessed warmth of the sun.  Felwithe flaunted such finery throughout the entire city, its delicate craftsmanship breathtaking to all who see it.  People came from lands all over Norrath just to gaze with awe-filled eyes at the wondrous High Elf city.<br>
<br>
So many years ago on her first pilgrimage to Felwithe, Laera stood ranked among those who gawked at the tremendous spires and arches rising above her.  As a first-year acolyte, she couldn’t imagine a more illustrious place existing in all the world.  Truly it must have been a place chosen of Tunare, second only to the dwelling place of the gods themselves.<br>
<br>
As a fifth-year near-graduate walking among its shadows on her way into the Temple, she’d trade it all for a glimpse of sunlight to warm away the goose bumps on her skin.  A chill breeze heralded the first stirrings of autumn’s approach, causing the shivering Wood Elf to tighten her meager towel around her shoulders.<br>
<br>
Trailing closely behind the messenger sent to retrieve her, Laera couldn’t help but wonder what this was all about. Head Mistress Netheel, while unceasingly kind and abruptly polite in day-to-day matters, rarely requested an audience with one of the acolytes unless there was a serious problem worthy of her direct attention.  Her mind reeling, Laera could think of nothing happening of late that would warrant sending a messenger with an urgent call to make an appearance. When Laera asked the messenger to wait while she changed into something more appropriate, he explained that he was instructed to bring her to the temple immediately upon finding her, so pressing was the request.  Seeing for the first time an overpowering sense of urgency from the messenger, Laera had realized something tremendous was afoot.  Seeing, too, the messenger’s winded state, Laera’s concern turned quickly to alarm.<br>
<br>
What could it possibly be?<br>
<br>
Lost in thought, Laera bumped into the messenger’s broad back as he stopped unexpectedly.  Stepping back sheepishly, she whispered her apologies.<br>
<br>
The messenger turned around to face her, his eyes modestly averted to the ground from her half-naked form.  Although modesty wasn’t a common attribute among Wood Elves, Laera was nevertheless his elder.  For a first-year acolyte messenger to gape at a fellow student four years his senior would be unseemly.<br>
<br>
He cleared his throat, obviously ill at ease.<br>
<br>
“I am to leave you now.  You are to enter alone and close the door behind you.”  The messenger glanced up to her face briefly and looked hurriedly looked away.  Laera couldn’t tell if his discomfort was merely a sign of his recent introduction to the guild or if he knew something about this she didn’t.<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” she said, placing her hand on his shoulder comfortingly.  “You performed your duty well  Go with Tunare.”<br>
<br>
Glancing up to her once again, the messenger smiled shyly before turning to leave.  <br>
<br>
Laera took a moment to collect herself before entering.  Taking a deep breath, she listened to the tittering sounds of birds chirping at each other amidst the grand treetops rising above her.   Off in the distance could be heard the laughter and splashing of the fishing pond she just came from.  All else was silent as the sun dipped below the lofty archway, filtering through the dense limbs of a tall sycamore beyond.  Laera took in what small warmth she could garner from the dappled sunlight playing across her towel.  <br>
<br>
Somehow she knew she was standing at a crossroads in her life.  Laera didn’t know how she knew, but something deep inside her was convinced that nothing would be the same once the sun set on this day.  It wasn’t a comforting feeling – it never was.  It was a feeling familiar to her, resurrecting memories of when her mother died of the chilled fever many winters ago.  She’d felt it during other periods of her life, like when she’d experienced her first kiss, and during the recent invasion of Kelethin by the Crushbone Orcs.  She’d felt it when she decided to become a druid of Tunare.  Each and every time she felt it, life inevitably changed, never to return to the way things were before.<br>
<br>
Laera looked solemnly at the sun’s gradual descent behind the sheltering leaves.  She’d expected to encounter this feeling at the coming graduation.  Its early arrival unnerved her to no end, placing melancholia where, by all rights, there should be revelry in celebrating her achievements at the school.  She had the uncanny feeling she was being robbed of something she had every right to possess, and there was nothing she could do to keep it.<br>
<br>
But it was just a feeling – nothing more.<br>
<br>
Closing her eyes, she whispered a small prayer for comfort as she slid open the heavy stone door and stepped inside the temple.<br>
<br>
The muted light within belied its comforting warmth.  Laera found herself bathed in soft shadows as she crossed the entryway and closed the door quietly behind her.  She’d always found it curious how such grandeur of the city surrounded this simple and humble temple dedicated to such a wondrous goddess.  Not that it wasn’t elegant by anyone’s standards; sculpted marble columns graced each corner of the pristine chapel.  Still, rather than a grandiose structure with vaulted ceilings and frescoes gracing every nook, Tunare chose a simple, functional dwelling for her worshippers – reminding them of the value of humility.<br>
<br>
As Laera’s eyes adjusted to the relative darkness of the chapel after closing the door on the sunlight outside, the hooded image of the head mistress coalesced before her, dressed in her usual unadorned brown robes.<br>
<br>
Stepping forward, one hand holding the towel together at her throat, Laera bowed before the head mistress.<br>
<br>
“Summoned by your call and the call of the Mother, I stand before you,” Laera spoke softly, her timid words echoing across the chapel.<br>
<br>
“Welcome into Tunare’s arms, child,” came Head Mistress Netheel’s usual succinct response.  She extended her hand as she would extend a blessing.  “Rise and present yourself, child, to Yeolarn Bronzeleaf, High Priest of Tunare.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s heart caught in her throat as the name Yeolarn Bronzeleaf was spoken.  Straightening her bow, she turned to see for the first time the figure standing at the head of the chapel.  Resplendent in his ceremonial armor, he stood, his eyes grimly boring a hole straight through her.<br>
<br>
Flustered at her unbecoming appearance as she stood in the presence of this important High Elf, Laera padded timidly across the marble floor before him and bowed.<br>
<br>
“I-,“ she cleared her throat nervously.  “I am deeply honored, your grace.”<br>
<br>
The high priest’s eyes lowered piercingly as they observed Laera bow before him, his grim expression fixed in a mask of gravity.  Without ceremony or even acknowledgement of Laera’s greeting, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf turned his attention to the head mistress.<br>
<br>
“This is she?”  His eyebrow raised questioningly.<br>
<br>
“She is, your grace,” Head Mistress Netheel replied with a small bow, her statement voiced with a familiar tone of finality.<br>
<br>
The high priest’s attention returned to the prostrate Wood Elf before him.<br>
<br>
“Rise, child, and show yourself to me,” his voice rang out starkly throughout the marble hall.<br>
<br>
Laera stood erect once more, turning a questioning glance to the head mistress, who nodded without a word.<br>
<br>
Unsure of herself, Laera removed the towel from around her shoulders, letting it fall to rest at her feet.  Restless and momentarily unsure of what to do with her hands, she fidgeted briefly before letting them fall to her sides.  Standing before the spiritual leader of all Tunare’s children stood Laera Nellynwae, acolyte druid, dressed in nothing more than her one-piece, form-fitting swimsuit.  Her face burning, she fervently wished the ground would miraculously open and swallow her up, saving her from this humiliating plight.<br>
<br>
As a drill sergeant would inspect his troops, so did Yeolarn Bronzeleaf inspect Laera.  Clasping his hands firmly behind his back, he slowly paced a leisurely circuit around her, studying her every inch as a jeweler would appraise a newly cut gem.  Noting every curve, every attribute, he completed his short stroll and came to stand before her once again.  Tossing his head back loftily, he looked her squarely in the face.<br>
<br>
“This is not the physique of a warrior,” he stated definitively.  “She must be able to hold her own in battle, should things go awry.”<br>
<br>
“Rest assured, your grace, she has a full grasp of all self-defense techniques taught every druid,” came the head mistress’s response.<br>
<br>
“A druid’s training in combat is miniscule compared to that of a paladin.”  The high priest took on a lecturing stance as he ticked off each item with his fingers.  “Strength, devotion, and the ability to wield Tunare’s holy power.  Those are the prerequisites for selection.”<br>
<br>
“And the purity of a youthful heart, your grace.  Will you find among Tynkale’s students a paladin which can fulfill the… the task at hand?”<br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf looked pointedly at the head mistress, noting her hesitation, but saying nothing.<br>
<br>
“I say no,” she continued, unabated.  “For paladin training, by its very nature, utterly precludes it.  Tunare’s power is granted only to the seasoned among their ranks.  Seasoned, I believe, past what can be termed ‘youthful’ for our purposes.”<br>
<br>
The head mistress stepped forward, tossing her hood back and allowing the light of the chapel to illuminate her careworn features.   Her silvery hair shined brilliantly in the torchlight, its softness framing her serious face.<br>
<br>
“Yes, a paladin or even a cleric may best suit the letter of what is needed.”  Placing a hand gently upon the high priest’s arm, she spoke earnestly.  “But search your heart, I beg you.  You will see, as I do, this is a task best suited for a druid, whose training does not lie in the front row before Tunare’s pulpit.”<br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf’s contemplative scowl returned to Laera standing before him.  It was true, a druid’s training was far removed from those of paladins or clerics.  Tunare and Her teachings come well into play in a druid’s life who has sworn such fealty, most certainly.  But where it is the indisputable focus of a cleric or paladin’s existence, a druid merely uses it as a guideline as they care for the Mother’s creations in day to day matters.  <br>
<br>
Sighing softly to himself, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf turned about, frustrated.  His hands resting on his hips he shook his head in exasperation.<br>
<br>
“I begin to fear we will find no suitable candidate.  I question that such a person exists in all the world, much less within our reach on Faydwer.”<br>
<br>
Her hand returning to her side, the head mistress stared off in the distance.<br>
<br>
“Tunare’s requests are often… challenging... to fulfill, I agree.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s mind spun in a whirlwind of thought as silence engulfed the chapel.  This had gone far beyond anything she expected.  On her way to the temple, she’d imagined that there was a dire problem to discuss regarding her graduation, or perhaps a special congregation was called of all senior students for their last day in Felwithe before entering the world as full druids.   Any number of possibilities had crossed her mind at the time, but never did she imagine an issue so pressing it confounded even the high priest himself.<br>
<br>
The situation was near unimaginable.  Here she was, having been whisked away from the fishing pond on a moment’s notice, not allowed to so much as change into more suitable garments in which to visit Tunare’s Temple, standing half-naked before Yeolarn Bronzeleaf – spiritual leader and representative of Tunare for all Elven followers – as he scrutinizes her appearance and blatantly discusses her inadequacies with her head mistress as if Laera weren’t even there!  What once she met with confusion and humility, now galled her.  <br>
<br>
Shifting her weight nervously from one foot to the other, she flexed her hands as they hung next to her legs.<br>
<br>
“Your grace,” she heard her own voice say.<br>
<br>
Half-turning, the high priest glanced at Laera over his shoulder, his eyes showing a marked displeasure at having his thoughts interrupted by a mere acolyte.<br>
<br>
Undaunted, Laera continued speaking, much to her own surprise as to the surprise of those present.<br>
<br>
“I-I… don’t know why I have been called here now, nor do I understand what issues revolve around it.”  She swallowed.  “But I… did hear Tunare’s name spoken amid the fragments of what was said.  I just… wanted to say that whatever it is… if it is Tunare’s will… I will do whatever it takes to complete it.  Whatever qualifications I have to meet, I will meet, be it prowess in combat or a show of faith.”<br>
<br>
Laera stood taller as she spoke, her aspect turning from docile to assertive.<br>
<br>
“I am a servant of Tunare,” she said with dignity.  “Where She says to go, I will go.  What She says to do, I will do.  If I don’t know how to do what She asks of me, I will learn.  What strength I need to fulfill Her calling, I will gain, because I believe-“  Becoming choked up, Laera took a moment’s pause to collect herself before continuing calmly.  Placing a hand on her chest she spoke.   “I believe she is truly the Mother of All, and asks of us only what we are able to offer, and no more.”<br>
<br>
Head Mistress Netheel quietly turned to the high priest, her face unreadable.  Yeolarn Bronzeleaf’s expression had not changed one iota during Laera’s impassioned speech.  Calmly taking in her words, he stood gazing at her cryptically over his shoulder.  Sensing an end to her monologue, he finally turned around.  Stepping up to Laera, he leaned in to confront her, his face scant inches from hers.<br>
<br>
“You speak like a priestess, acolyte Nellynwae,” he spoke softly.  “Your voice exudes conviction as you claim to espouse Tunare’s will as Her devoted servant.  Most unusual and, frankly, refreshing to find in a druid of your years.”  Any hint of kindness left his voice.  “But I wonder if such conviction would lose its thunder when put to the test.  I question whether such devotion would fail you, should you find yourself bleeding to death on the battlefield with Innoruuk’s blade through your belly and no sign of Tunare or Her hosts to be seen.  What happens when you leave the protection of the druid’s sanctuary and enter the real world, facing blood and hatred and darkness that threaten to tear open your body, steal your soul and feed it to Innoruuk’s insatiable appetites?  Where is your faith then, child?  Tell me.”<br>
<br>
A tear slipped out from behind Laera’s eyelid, wetting the corner of her eye.<br>
<br>
“Your grace-“  The head mistress spoke, trying to placate the high priest, but his ire was not to be deterred.<br>
<br>
“Once in the clutches of the Prince of Hate’s followers, all light dwellers are torn asunder body, mind and soul.  Once under their control, civility has no meaning as they brutally use everything you have and everything you are for their own perverted ends.  The Elven forces could not save you.  Tunare Herself could not save you.  You would be theirs.  Period.  And you would pray hourly for death to take you.<br>
<br>
“Yet here you stand barely out of diapers, touting your undying faith in Tunare?”  Yeolarn Bronzeleaf spoke succinctly.  “I… don’t… believe you.  You have no inkling of what true faith is.  Your words are rooted in the arrogance of a sheltered student who has the naivete to believe that her faith is insurmountable.  You have the impertinence to speak them before me when true soldiers of Tunare’s Army of Light are at this very moment struggling and dying for their faith?  It is an effrontery to their valor and dedication to the greater good!”<br>
<br>
Laera opened her mouth silently, tears coursing down her cheeks.  Her hands balled into tiny fists at her sides, she could only utter strangled gasps as she tried to find the proper words to say.<br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf stole a glance out the corner of his eye at the head mistress.  Her look implacable, she met his gaze with calm resolve, edged with a hint of displeasure.  <br>
<br>
“You submit this child to bear the weight of Zeranon’s Pact?”  The high priest didn’t wait for an answer.  “Then so be it!”<br>
<br>
With the ringing of steel against steel, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf withdrew a small dagger from his belt, reached out to grasp at Laera’s swimsuit, and deftly sliced open the shoulder fabric in one clean swipe of the blade.  Panicked at the sudden advance from the high priest, Laera yelped and collapsed to the floor, clutching the torn remains of her suit to her chest. <br>
<br>
“What was started is now complete,” Yeolarn Bronzeleaf spoke tersely and with hurried efficiency, as if to stand any longer on ceremony for her sake was to his distaste.  “Let it be known to all that a new defender of nature and life has joined the ranks of light in the name of Tunare.  Stand now amongst your colleagues, Druid Nellynwae, and go forth into Norrath to your work.”<br>
<br>
Tossing aside the blade with a jerk of his gauntleted hand, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf stepped over Laera’s cowering form and strode to the entryway.  Pausing before the stone door, he turned back to the two stunned women.<br>
<br>
“May Tunare have mercy upon us all if you are wrong… Head Mistress Netheel.”<br>
<br>
Turning sharply, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf hefted the heavy door aside to storm his way out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A sob escaped Laera’s throat as she lay on the hard marble floor in the Temple of Tunare.  One hand covered her grieved face while the other held up her torn swimsuit in a half-successful attempt at modesty.  She’d heard and recognized the words of her graduation ceremony as the high priest recited them, only instead of being spoken with honor and praise, he twisted them into a terrible mockery of her rite of passage.  The vicious tear in her swimsuit shoulder would normally have been performed on the caducel symbol in the same place on her acolyte robes, symbolizing a sundering of what she was as an acolyte into what she had become as a full druid.  Now it stood to symbolize the depths of the high priest’s contempt for her.<br>
<br>
Letting loose another sob, Laera’s shoulders heaved as bitter tears ran unchecked down her face.  This wasn’t the way it was supposed to be.  Her day of happiness had been denied her, replaced by something she couldn’t even define.  All she knew is that nothing was what it was supposed to be, and the thought of what it was pierced into her soul like the dagger that divested her.<br>
<br>
Warm hands touched her shoulders in a futile attempt to calm her weeping.<br>
<br>
“Hush, child,” cooed Head Mistress Netheel.  “It’s all right.  Hush.  It’s okay.”<br>
<br>
In time, the head mistress’s ministrations calmed the distressed young druid.  Without any trace of her usually cold and removed demeanor, she assisted Laera off the floor and led her to the base of one of the chapel pillars where she could sit.  Drawing her knees to her chest, Laera rested her head wearily against them and pulled herself together.<br>
<br>
“What a terrible man,” came her muffled voice from within.<br>
<br>
“Child,” Head Mistress Netheel said, laying a comforting hand on Laera’s back.  “Yeolarn Bronzeleaf has led the followers of Tunare for decades in a valiant and honorable way.  He has entered the heart of darkness for the cause of light many times, knowing he would likely never return.  But return he has, only to take up Tunare’s banner and fulfill Her will yet again without pause or remission.  He is a truly great man who cares and sacrifices much for his flock.  For all of us.  For you.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s head jerked back suddenly, her tear-streaked face to confront the head mistress next to her.<br>
<br>
“Does that give him the right to… to treat his ‘flock’ like this?”  Holding out her torn swimsuit shoulder before the head mistress’ eyes, Laera’s normally pristine face shown in a twisted display of anguish.<br>
<br>
Blinking back an inaudible sigh, the head mistress took Laera’s hand – the hand holding her suit – in hers, cupping over it as a mother would her aggrieved child.<br>
<br>
“Yeolarn Bronzeleaf is many things,” she said patiently.  “He is brave and stalwart in his calling while at the same time he can be nurturing and giving.  I have seen him face adversity without hesitation, knowing the cause of Tunare was a just one.  But right now, child, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf is something I have never once seen him before.”<br>
<br>
Laera sniffed and distractedly wiped a cheek with a single swipe of her palm.  “What’s that,” she asked, halfheartedly.<br>
<br>
“He is afraid, child,” came the head mistress’ response.  Slowly shaking her head to lend sincere feeling to her words, she pressed on.  “He is so terribly afraid.  Events to come and what they will mean for his people should things go wrong terrify him deeply, because this time all control is out of his hands.  My child, you have no idea of the profound workings the gods have embarked upon.<br>
<br>
 “So please forgive the high priest his shortcomings in coping with things.  He is worried and frustrated with a thousand different things pulling at him regarding this issue, and his sense of impotence in resolving it has taken its toll.  I think his head has not so much as touched a pillow in no less than eight days as he has searched ceaselessly for the proper candidate.”<br>
<br>
Realizing the gravity of the situation she had just entered, Laera’s expression turned serious as she sullenly swiped at the tears marking her other cheek.<br>
<br>
“Candidate for what?  Am I the candidate?”<br>
<br>
“No,” the head mistress shook her head sadly.  “You were a candidate.  Now Yeolarn Bronzeleaf has selected you to be the champion of this dispensation.  You are now Tunare’s advocate in the Pact of Zeranon.”<br>
<br>
“Well, what-…what are you saying?”  Laera shook her head confusedly.  “He obviously felt I was totally unqualified for… whatever it is he’s looking to do.  He made it clear I wasn’t his first choice to handle a stray cat much less this… this…”  Laera waved her flustered hands about, searching for words.<br>
<br>
“Child, you must trust me.”  The head mistress’s soothing hands placated Laera’s frantic gestures.  “I am telling you right now that he would never have selected you and entrusted you with this responsibility if he thought for one moment that you were not the best chance of delivering Tunare’s call.”<br>
<br>
Laera glanced warily at Head Mistress Netheel’s solemn gaze, unsure.<br>
<br>
“He may have put on a display of discontent at what he was doing – placing so much responsibility onto the shoulders of a young Wood Elf druid ‘just barely out of her infancy.’ ”  The head mistress’s mimicking of the high priest’s gruff voice was so flawless, Laera couldn’t help but grin just a bit.  “But he sees, just as I do, that you are the one to take on this task.<br>
<br>
“And yes, this is truly a task of Tunare, child.”  The head mistress’ eyes grew unfocused.  “Perhaps the most important task She has sent us in centuries.”<br>
<br>
A chill ran up Laera’s spine at hearing those words.  A part of her still couldn’t grasp the idea that this was really happening to her.  She half-expected to wake in her bed, once again the victim of one of Jerrin’s childish pranks.  Still unaware of what the true matter was, she nevertheless grappled with the fact that it was now upon her, and whatever it was, she had to face it – a lesson  she learned soundly as an acolyte.<br>
<br>
The head mistress stood and returned to her usual manner, her tone officious once again.<br>
<br>
“The high priest has declared you a full druid of Tunare,” she said.  “But your studies have not ended.  If anything, they have just begun.  We have only a brief time in which to prepare before you leave on your journey.  We leave for Kelethin in the morning.  I shall give you one day to resettle once we arrive.  Upon daybreak the morning after, I will see you in my sanctuary fully dressed and ready to attend my personal instruction.  We have much work to do together in the days to come, child.  Are you ready to serve Tunare’s will?”<br>
<br>
Dropping her feet to the floor one at a time, Laera pushed against the pillar base to stand before her new instructor.<br>
<br>
“I am, mistress,” she said in a clear tone.<br>
<br>
“Excellent.  I look forward to working with you, Druid Nellynwae.”  Head Mistress Netheel let loose a private grin for Laera’s benefit.<br>
<br>
Laera nodded, not certain what to do now.<br>
<br>
“You may go, child,” the head mistress spoke in a wry undertone.  “You are no longer an acolyte with any need for dismissal from me.”<br>
<br>
Smiling to herself, she nodded sheepishly and padded barefoot to the entrance.<br>
<br>
“And Laera,” the head mistress’ voice rang from across the chapel.<br>
<br>
Jarred at hearing – for the first time ever – this woman speak her first name, Laera turned around.<br>
<br>
“Congratulations,” Head Mistress Netheel said with a broad smile.<br>
<br>
Slowly returning the smile, Laera nodded her thanks and stepped out the open doorway into the rapidly darkening city outside.<br>
<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 3 - Farewells</c><br>
<br>
The raucous chirping of crickets rang through Rigel’s ears.  He’d been sitting on the uncomfortable bench for nearly two hours now.  Peering out into the pitch black night of Greater Faydark from atop the tree city of Kelethin didn’t offer much in the way of scenery, perched amid the mighty treetops as it was.  Rigel’s only companions were the soft glow of the oil lantern dangling above his head and the occasional night watchman marching his weary patrol.<br>
<br>
Sighing cheerlessly, Rigel adjusted his seat for the thousandth time that night.  He’d considered lying down on the bench to catch a snooze before Laera decided to make her appearance, but his muscles ached at the mere the thought of napping on the rock-hard wood.  No, she would show up soon.  The note she’d left on his bunk said she would.<br>
<br>
Pulling out the note for the tenth time, he offhandedly scanned over the neat, concise writing left by her hand and tried his best to read between the lines.  Perhaps there was some clue what this was all about.<br>
<br>
It had been weeks since he’d so much as seen Laera, much less been able to talk with her.  He remembered that last day in Felwithe when she was called away so suddenly to the temple.  He also remembered seeing her return to the inn at nightfall that same eve, a pallid look marring her face.  When he approached her to see what was the matter, she distractedly waved him off with a limp hand, saying she would explain later.<br>
<br>
Later came, but no explanation came with it.  He’d not so much as caught a glimpse of her during the journey home to Kelethin.  The weeks that followed made it seem as if she had fallen off the face of Norrath.  Word among the acolytes was that she was in some sort of trouble with Head Mistress Netheel, and that her sudden removal from the rest of the acolytes was part of her punishment.  Whispered rumors spoke of her treks into the head mistress’s office every dawn, remaining there until well past nightfall – sometimes past even midnight, only to rise again at daybreak.  Something was terribly wrong, and Rigel became increasingly worried with each passing day.<br>
<br>
At long last, his keen ears detected a soft pattering of feet against the wooden planks in the distance – quite a distinction from the usual hammering ruckus the steel-clad guards made.  Rigel’s patient anticipation was rewarded as he saw his friend’s hooded figure pad its way stealthily toward him from the darkness.  His heart leaped as he saw her.  He wanted to cry out her name in greeting, but the note said to keep this meeting a secret just between the two of them.<br>
<br>
Even so, seeing her approach made the past lonely weeks vanish instantly.  It was all right now – she would explain it all to him.<br>
<br>
Rising from the bench, Rigel rushed up to her.  The two Wood Elves embraced warmly, not a word passing between them.  None were needed.  The eagerness of their hug spoke volumes of how they’d missed each other’s company for so long.<br>
<br>
“Oh, Rigel,” came Laera’s whispered voice in his ear, breaking the silence.  “It is so good to see you.”<br>
<br>
Rigel’s only response was a tightening of his embrace, comforting himself in the moment.  She was with him again, that’s all that mattered and nothing could change it – for the time being, anyway.<br>
<br>
Offhandedly tossing her hood back, Laera exposed her face to the flickering lamplight. <br>
<br>
“Look at you,” she said with a fond smile, taking in Rigel’s appearance is if she hadn’t seen him for months.  “You haven’t changed a bit.  I know it’s only been a short while since I last saw you, but so much has happened, it seems like years have gone by.”<br>
<br>
Seeing her now, he didn’t doubt it.  Rigel suppressed his look of surprise at how much Laera had changed in the past few weeks.  He looked into her lucid, green eyes and immediately noticed that the person looking back at him was no longer the capricious young girl he knew.  Far from it.  Laera’s features exuded a seriousness he’d never seen before.  In the past, he had questioned whether his fun-loving friend had a serious bone in her body.  Now he found himself wondering where that girl had gone.<br>
<br>
Instead of making comment to this fact, Rigel decided to focus on their reunion.<br>
<br>
“It’s good to see you too, Lae,” he said.  “You wouldn’t believe the crazy gossip that have been flying around about you.  Every time I turned around, it seemed like someone had seen or heard something else to add to the rumor mill.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah,” Laera winced with distaste.  “I’m sure they have.  As wild as rumors get, I’m afraid they couldn’t come close to what’s really been going on.”<br>
<br>
Placing a hand to her forehead wearily, she led Rigel to sit back down on the wooden bench beside her.<br>
<br>
“By the way, I’m sorry for being so late.”  She looked at Rigel with sincere regret.  “I had no idea today’s lesson would go on so long.”<br>
<br>
“No, no,” he shook his head emphatically.  “Are you kidding?  I’m just glad you made it.”<br>
<br>
Smiling her thanks for his patient forgiveness, Laera let out a soft sigh, not knowing where to begin.<br>
<br>
“Oh, Rigel.  So much has happened, I just don’t know where to begin.”<br>
<br>
“Well…” Now that the time had come, Rigel wasn’t sure where he really wanted her to begin.  “Is it true that you’re in trouble?  What did you do?”<br>
<br>
“Heh,” Laera shook her head with a sad smile.  “No, I’m not in trouble.  At least, not like you mean it.”<br>
<br>
A look of confusion crossed Rigel’s boyish face.<br>
<br>
“Well, what’s been going on, then?  Why haven’t you been around?  I mean, you haven’t even been sleeping in the dorms or performing the graduation trials or anything.  The most I’ve been able to gather is that you’ve been spending a lot of time with the head mistress, and that she’s refused to meet with anyone else but you.”<br>
<br>
“I know, Rigel, and I’m so sorry for disappearing like I have, but it’s been necessary.  Believe me, I’ve wanted so much to be close by, even just so I could have someone to talk to.  As it is, Head Mistress Netheel has every second that I’m not sleeping scheduled for her lessons.  We even eat every meal together as we go through my studies.”<br>
<br>
Rigel’s face turned incredulous.<br>
<br>
“Studying?”  He stammered.  “You’ve been studying?  For what?  It can’t be for graduation, the others-“<br>
<br>
“No, it has nothing to do with graduation.”  Licking her lips, Laera frantically tried to think of how to broach the subject.  When at last she spoke, it was with hesitation.  “It’s to prepare me.  You see, tomorrow night  I’m… I’m leaving.”<br>
<br>
Rigel’s expression turned incredulous, his eyes gleaming wide as silver coins.<br>
<br>
“What?”  He asked breathlessly.  “Leaving?  Where?  Why?  Laera, please tell me what’s going on!”<br>
<br>
“Shush, please.  I’m not even supposed to be here,” Laera placated her friend softly.  Turning her head, she checked to see if there was anyone nearby who could have heard her friend’s outburst.<br>
<br>
“What about next week’s graduation?”  Rigel’s piercing whisper was hardly covert.<br>
<br>
Turning back quickly, Laera’s features shown startled in the flickering lamplight.  His comment about graduation had the unexpected result of disturbing her otherwise imperturbable aspect.  Though he couldn’t fathom what it was about graduation that could distress her so, Rigel saw her gaze turn unfocused.<br>
<br>
“Graduation,” she said distractedly.  “It’s so soon, is it?  I’d lost track of time.”<br>
<br>
“Lae,” Rigel placed his hand on hers.  “You have to tell me what’s going on.”<br>
<br>
Focusing again on Rigel’s face, Laera sheltered his grasping hand with her own.<br>
<br>
“Rigel, I-… I’m afraid I won’t be at graduation,” she spoke in a wavering voice.  “You see, I’ve already… I’ve already had my ceremony.  I’m a druid now.  I have been since leaving Felwithe.”<br>
<br>
Rigel’s world was being torn apart by the seams.  Just when he’d come to grips with his life as an acolyte, some unseen power decided it was time to change things yet again.  Here was his friend – the only friend he’d had since coming to study at the school, and the best friend he’d had in his life – telling him that not only is life changing, but it had actually changed weeks ago and he never knew it.  What was happening?  Who was doing it?  More the point, why did it have to be her?  Didn’t they know he needed her?  Didn’t they realize what she meant to him?<br>
<br>
Rigel could only stare into Laera’s eyes, his mouth agape.<br>
<br>
Dropping her gaze to their joined hands in his lap, Laera swallowed.<br>
<br>
“Rigel, I know this is hard,” she whispered.  “But, I’m asking you to try and understand.  I don’t know much about what is happening, and what I do know I can’t tell you much.  What’s important right now is that I’m leaving on a journey far away, I can’t tell you where I’m headed and I probably won’t be coming back for quite a while.  <br>
<br>
“You see, something is going on – something very big, and like it or not, I’m caught up in it.  I’ve been given my instructions and that’s all I’ve been given, but I suspect-“  Laera paused, looking again into the darkness for eavesdroppers.  Leaning in closely, Laera spoke in confidence.  “I suspect it has something to do with the Teir’Dal.”<br>
<br>
Rigel drew in a quick breath, Laera quickly placing her hand over his mouth.<br>
<br>
“Keep it down,” she whispered tersely.  Removing her hand from his alarmed face, she went on.  “I’m being sent out as some sort of emissary or something.  That’s all I can say.”<br>
<br>
“What are you talking about, Lae?”  Rigel was frantic, but at least he kept his voice moderate.  “The Teir’Dal… If what you’re saying is true, then… then…”<br>
<br>
Laera nodded solemnly.  The Teir’Dal were the mortal enemy of the Wood Elves or any other light dwelling race for that matter.  Whatever business she was tangled up in, if it involved the Dark Elves, the portents were dire.  Either Laera was on her way to Nektulos Forest – an unthinkable notion – or the Teir’Dal were on the move en masse outside their homeland, which could only mean one thing.<br>
<br>
War.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, Rigel,” Laera spoke with remorse.  “I really wish I could say more, but I’m afraid I can’t.  I don’t even know much more than I’ve told you – they won’t tell me what this is all about.  Here I’m training feverishly in battle techniques and spells I’m hardly even qualified  to learn yet, about to be sent off to a continent I’ve never seen before.  Most of the lessons I’m being taught are whirlwinds of information I can barely grasp.  I’m lost, alone and confused, and I-”<br>
<br>
Laera cut off her sentence, her words catching in her throat.<br>
<br>
“And I’m scared,” she whispered.  Breaking down in frustrated despair, Laera fell to lay her head against her friend’s comforting shoulder.<br>
<br>
Rigel mentally beat himself over the head as he placed his arms comfortingly around her, the soft fabric of her thick woven robe feeling warm against the chilling night.  All this time he was selfishly thinking about how her absence affected him and his own situation, resenting for his own sake the powers-that-be that were taking her away.  He hadn’t stopped to think about what may be happening on her end in this mess and how it may have been affecting her.  Seeing his once jovial and waggish companion in such despair like this broke his heart.  What in Tunare’s name could possibly be happening that they should do this to someone so kind-hearted and carefree? <br>
<br>
In Laera’s rushed and fragmented explanation of things, Rigel was able to piece together that something was definitely happening that would probably touch the lives of everyone in Kelethin – perhaps even beyond.  But such things were for heroes and champions to contend with, not acolytes fresh out of training.  What role Laera could possibly play in something so grand eluded him.  If they had found in Laera what they were looking for, why couldn’t it have been someone – anyone else?  It’s not as if Kelethin wasn’t overflowing with young, guileless Wood Elf females.  Why did they have to pick his friend?<br>
<br>
Not only that, but sending Laera out alone was plain recklessness, in his piqued opinion.  Any number of things could happen to her in the cold, heartless realms.  In the untamed wilderness, you never knew what was lying in wait to dole out their own variety of harm.  Bandits and vagabonds hid around the bends in every pass.  Bloodthirsty Orcs infested every land in some capacity or another, searching for their unwary victims.  The hosts of the undead haunted more than their share of lands at night.  All this, and they were sending her without any escort whatsoever?  <br>
<br>
Pulling back gently, Laera placed her hands on Rigel’s forearms in a gentle mountaineer’s grip.  Her eyes downcast, they didn’t see the darkening scowl that crossed her friend’s face.<br>
<br>
“I need to be going,” she spoke sadly.  “I have preparations to make before leaving tomorrow evening, and only a few hours left tonight to sleep.”<br>
<br>
Rigel didn’t know what to say.  All the things he’d planned on saying at her graduation completely fled his mind, and probably wouldn’t fit the circumstances anyway.  Defeated, only one question mattered to him now.<br>
<br>
“Can I be there?” he asked with a somber bearing.  “Can I be there to say goodbye as you go?”<br>
<br>
Smiling her sweetest smile, Laera kissed Rigel’s forehead.<br>
<br>
“Please do,” she whispered.  “It wouldn’t be right if you weren’t there.”<br>
<br>
Standing, Laera placed her hand fondly on Rigel’s shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Be at the training ground lift at dusk,” she said softly.  “I’ll be there waiting for you.”<br>
<br>
Turning quietly, Laera replaced her hood and stole off into the darkness beyond without a sound, leaving the crestfallen acolyte behind in the lamplight.  <br>
<br>
Raising his hand, Rigel gently placed his fingertips against his forehead.  It tingled in the spot where her soft lips met his skin, as if he could still feel their sweet presence.  He was certain he always would.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dreketh practically ripped the door from its hinges as she entered her quarters.  Slamming the door shut behind her, she cursed a vulgar oath under her breath as she stalked her way toward the closet across the cold, unyielding granite floor.<br>
<br>
That overbearing, self-righteous demagogue of a guild master had no business treating her as he did.  None of the other shadow knights had to live up to the insane expectations Nezzka Tolax demanded of her.  During all nighttime hours, Dreketh was to dedicate herself heart, mind and soul to the study of melee combat in the arena.  Come daybreak, when the other shadow knights went to bed to rest up, she was taken, often forcibly, into the Neriak library to study military tactics and strategies.  It wasn’t until well past noon – the equivalent of midnight to a Dark Elf – she was finally allowed her tidbit of sleep.  It was absurd, the standard she was expected to live up to.<br>
<br>
Swinging wide the closet door, Dreketh gripped the straps of her travelling pack resting on the top shelf.  With a great heave, she flung it across the room to land on her ascetic bed in a heap.<br>
<br>
He had no right to impose such responsibility on her, simply because she happened to be an inconvenience on his little group of tin soldiers.  It wasn’t her fault that deranged priest N’Threk demanded this imposition of him by transferring her to his guild.  She was every bit a victim in this fool arrangement, too.  The entire situation was the most ridiculous thing she’d ever experienced.<br>
<br>
Unlocking the chest next to her night stand, Dreketh threw open the lid and began stashing her belongings angrily into the pack.<br>
<br>
She was a necromancer, by all the gods – a fully ordained and named practitioner of the dark arts.  You don’t take a gifted spell caster out of her element, throw her in the midst of some over-glorified foot soldier lackeys, and expect her to perform as if she were the firstborn of Rallos Zek.  You just don’t!  Not only that, but you don’t train her in the art of two-handed weaponry for five weeks, then proceed to hand her a short sword and expect her to defeat an ogre wielding a club twice her height!<br>
<br>
Having emptied the chest, Dreketh moved on to the bureau.  Sliding open the drawers, she began to unload its contents onto the floor, intending to sort  them out into those pieces of clothing she needed to take with her and those she could leave behind.<br>
<br>
On top of it all, what really got to her was how Tolax felt the need to make her look foolish in front of all the others.  Wasn’t it difficult enough for some freakish necromancer to make acquaintances among the rank and file of his knights?  His screaming about how useless she was in front of her so-called “peers” guaranteed that the already slim chance of melding with the others was made downright impossible.  Nobody wanted to befriend a screw-up.<br>
<br>
Having emptied the bureau, Dreketh whirled about angrily to face the stack of clothes lying piled in the center of the floor.  Her frustration getting the best of her, she kicked at the pile furiously, sending her garments flying scattered through the air.  Collapsing to the floor, Dreketh gnashed her teeth together in impotent rage.  Pressing the heels of her hands to her eyes, she took deep breaths and tried to get a grip on herself.<br>
<br>
Nostrils flaring, Dreketh managed to reign her emotions, becoming once again their master as she had been taught.  The words of her tutors spoke silently in her mind: Anger was a weapon.  It was the fire that fed the burning power of hate.  But like any weapon, its power must be used responsibly.  A finely balanced blade in the hands of its master presented deadly power to defeat an enemy, while the same blade in the hands of an incompetent fool would likely skewer him.  Similarly, the same fires of anger that could reduce an enemy to ashes could flare out of control and become the enemy’s most valuable exploit.<br>
<br>
Opening her fingers, Dreketh ran them tediously through her long, white hair.  Her vision clearing, she let out a long, drawn-out breath.  The once immaculate room was now a disaster area.  Clothes surrounded her, covering nearly every square foot of her private chambers.<br>
<br>
Sighing, Dreketh let her hands fall limply next to her as she sat on the floor, despondent.  What was the use?  She was leaving come moonrise, and she would finally be free of the mad priest and his cohort, Tolax.  If nothing else, at least she would finally get a full sleep for the first time in countless weeks.<br>
<br>
Dreketh rose to her feet and stepped wearily to her bedroom window overlooking the courtyard far below.  Absently toying with the pendent drawstrings of her pale shirt, she sat with one leg on the sill and watched the comings and goings of her fellow Teir’Dal down at the gate.  Seeing the small blue figures as they went about their ordinary day-to-day business, she silently envied them.  To be ordinary with ordinary concerns and ordinary tasks to perform seemed oddly compelling to her.  It seemed strange how most people spent their lives trying to break free of the menial things, attempting to gain some excitement in life, while Dreketh sat in her window longing to return to a time when she wasn’t always the exception to the rule.<br>
<br>
From this distance high above in the Lodge of the Dead, everything seemed so peaceful.  Dreketh imagined the gods viewed Norrath in a similar way.  She offhandedly wondered if they looked down upon the mortals scurrying on the ground below and felt similar feelings of longing as she did.<br>
<br>
A knock at her door interrupted Dreketh’s musings.  <br>
<br>
“Who comes?” she called out, casting an irritated glance toward the entrance.<br>
<br>
Unannounced, the latch clicked and the heavy oaken door began to swing open silently on its hinges.  Alarmed at this sudden intrusion, Dreketh’s burdensome training kicked in.  Almost of its own accord, her dagger slipped from the sheath strapped to her thigh, finding its way to her hand.  Poised and ready to be released at a moment’s notice, the blade rested sharply in the grip of her blue, lithesome fingers.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s keen reflexes were checked, however, upon recognizing the one individual she gave leave to freely enter her dwelling.  Seeing Xon Quexill’s familiar face instantly drove away the shadows of gloom that so haunted her thoughts.<br>
<br>
“Master Xon!”  Her dagger hadn’t hit the floor before Dreketh was nestled in the strong embrace of her mentor, her arms draped around his neck.  The powerful hands that had nearly destroyed her in the Hall of the Dead only weeks before now reached up to hold her tenderly.  <br>
<br>
“I can’t believe you’re here,” she continued.  “I feared your sabbatical would keep you away long after I was to leave.”<br>
<br>
“Fear not, child.  I am here,” came Quexill’s soothing tone.  “And rest assured my sabbatical remains.”<br>
<br>
Drawing back, Dreketh looked her surrogate father in the eyes, questioningly.<br>
<br>
“I have returned for one purpose only,” he continued with a fond smile gracing his striking face.  “To see you once more before you depart on your mission.”<br>
<br>
Looking from one of his eyes to the other, Dreketh grasped for words to express her gratitude.  Searching in vain, Dreketh could only resume her fond display of affection by holding him close once again.<br>
<br>
Quexill wondered at his protégé’s curiously tight embrace.  While such displays between them were commonplace in private, he sensed her enthusiasm was more than mere excitement at his unexpected arrival.  Glancing over her shoulder, he suddenly noticed the disarray her room was in.  <br>
<br>
“What is this?”  Quexill gently broke their embrace.  Leaning down, he picked up a silken dress shirt from off the floor and held it up, inspecting it.  Tilting his head, he cast Dreketh a pointed look, silently asking her what this was all about.<br>
<br>
Reaching up resignedly, Dreketh snatched the shirt from Quexill’s fingers and absently began to fold it with uneasy hands.  <br>
<br>
“Nothing,” she muttered.  “I was just… I needed to blow off some steam.  That’s all.”  Her hands worked of their own accord, distractedly tucking and folding the shirt into a variety of misshapen forms.<br>
<br>
“Well,” Quexill made a show of glancing around.  “At least I see no broken shards of glass or pottery strewn about this time.  Either your temper has calmed during my absence, or your current predicament demands no irreparable damage.”<br>
<br>
Glancing up with a furtive smirk, Dreketh couldn’t help but release a self-conscious chuckle, her hands still absently fidgeting with the shirt to no avail.<br>
<br>
“I trust your studies have been proceeding… adequately?” Quexill ventured a guess at what vexed her, raising an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
Giving up the shirt for a lost cause, Dreketh heaved an exasperated sigh.  Tossing it by the wayside, she stalked her way to the foot of her bed where she slumped down to sit.  Her jaw worked voicelessly as she tried to figure out where to begin her tirade.  Giving up, she decided only one question would cover the extent of her anxiety.<br>
<br>
“What am I doing?”  She threw her arms up in resignation, allowing them to land in her lap as she looked across the room at her mentor.<br>
<br>
“I don’t understand,” Quexill tilted his head and stepped forward.<br>
<br>
“What am I doing?”  Dreketh repeated.  “Here, I mean.  The past weeks of furiously working to build up my strength, learning battle techniques, studying all about becoming a knight… for what?”<br>
<br>
“To serve the will of Innoruuk,” Quexill shrugged, as if the answer should be obvious.<br>
<br>
“But how is this serving His will?”  Dreketh challenged.  “By running off to meet with some ghastly light dweller, whom I should sooner see burn in Ro’s fire than allow to even speak my name?  Please try to explain how this serves the will of Innoruuk, because the mad priest can’t seem to focus his dullard mind enough to give me a straight answer.”<br>
<br>
Blinking momentarily, Quexill carefully considered what to do.  Having heard the prophecy of Zeranon and having seen the visions of Innoruuk, he had to be careful how much he told his young charge.  In fact, a large part of his time away had been spent wrestling with the dilemma of what she was to know and what she wasn’t.  Weeks of soul-searching had taken their toll on the master necromancer, to little avail.  Now he was confronted with the inescapable decision that weeks of evasion could not spare him.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh,” he spoke delicately, sitting down on the bed next to her.  “I know the demands being placed on you have been excruciating.  I know all the things you have been forced to endure these past weeks are completely unjust, difficult even for an experienced knight.  Though it pains me to say it, I fear your hardships have only just begun, child.  Please understand that they were – and are – completely necessary.  The skills and knowledge you have gained as a shadow knight are imperative to the success of your mission.”  Quexill placed his hand on his chest. “And they were lessons I could not teach you.  Because of the efforts of your relentless training you are now a stronger person, ready to undertake the mission you have been selected to fulfill.”<br>
<br>
“To bond with and protect my light dweller counterpart,” Dreketh spat the quoted words of the high priest bitterly.  “But to what ends?  Where are we to go?  Why have I been given such explicit instructions without meaning or purpose behind what I am to do?”<br>
<br>
“Why care?”  Quexill opened his palms wide.  “Just look at what you have become in just a few short weeks, compared to what you were before under my tutelage.  You now know how to wield a blade measuring longer than a mere dagger.  You have an excellent grasp of fundamental combat tactics.  Your very touch can literally obliterate the life force of your enemies – a skill I will never know.  In time, you will be allowed to exercise the greater part of your necromantic powers once again, ascending you to a level where you can do anything you wish, so long as the Pact is served.  Is that such a high price for the opportunities you have been given?  For all you have worked for with sweat and blood?” <br>
<br>
Rubbing her forehead, Dreketh considered the words of her mentor.<br>
<br>
Quexill pressed on.  “As of tomorrow, your fast and furious training will be at an end.  You must admit, the torment was really quite transitory.  You will have learned in a blink what it takes any other trainee years to grasp.  Years, child.  Your remarkable accomplishment shines as an example of what is possible under Innoruuk’s hateful eye, and I am insurmountably proud to be your father.”<br>
<br>
Her brow furrowed, Dreketh appeared ashamed of her cynicism.<br>
<br>
“The pride upon my name comes from your wisdom,” she whispered.  Placing her arms around Quexill’s neck, she embraced her surrogate father again.  “I shan’t let you down.  Not ever.”<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill basked in the moment of her warmth, as he knew it was likely to be the last time he was to feel her tender touch.  Through this girl, his cold Teir’Dal heart had discovered a purpose above and beyond that of obtaining power.  For the first time in his life, he knew what it was to care for someone more than he cared for himself.  Had Dreketh asked, there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t have done for her.  Considering what he had seen in the old priest’s vision for the Pact of Zeranon, it was probably fortunate she remained unaware of this fact.<br>
<br>
“I have something for you, child,” he whispered.  “Something very important.”<br>
<br>
Curious, Dreketh withdrew to give her mentor a quizzical look.<br>
<br>
“In fact, it is remarkable how coincidence can present itself to be taken advantage of at times,” Xon Quexill spoke with irony as he stood and paced his lengthy stride to the open door.  <br>
<br>
Leaning down into the hallway outside, he dragged an enormous, metal crate into the room by its baroque handle.  Rising quickly with the intention of helping him in his burden, Dreketh was quickly waved back down by her mentor.<br>
<br>
“When Nezzka Tolax came to me years ago and asked if I would take you into the necromancer’s guild, he did so out of a sense of duty,” Quexill explained.  “Your parents, you see, served under his command.  To introduce you into his own guild following their… untimely deaths would have caused some complications, needless to say.”<br>
<br>
“I know all this,” Dreketh said with a shrug and a patient half-smile.  “You explained this to me a long time ago.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, indeed,” Quexill responded, raising his index finger.  “But what I didn’t tell you, is that I was also given custody of your parents’ legacy.”<br>
<br>
Placing his hand atop the enormous crate, Quexill made a show of displaying it for her benefit.  “Until now, I had debated with myself when the proper time was to give it into your possession.  After all,” the necromancer unfastened the latch and pulled open the lid effortlessly,  “until now, after becoming a knight, you really had no use for it.”<br>
<br>
Quexill watched as Dreketh’s cautious face approached the crate and peered over its edge.  Her clear azure eyes turned to him in wonderment, seeking unspoken affirmation.  Seeing her mentor nod, she returned her gaze to the contents of the box.<br>
<br>
Inside, she could see an assortment of brilliant plate armor, crafted from pure bronze and placed neatly among molded slots within.   Reaching inside, Dreketh pulled forth a shining gauntlet that reflected the light of her room in a radiant display of rich, deep color.<br>
<br>
“This was my father’s?” she asked.  Turning the gauntlet about, she studied it with rapt eyes.<br>
<br>
“Your father’s suit of armor was never recovered, I’m sorry to say,” Quexill spoke with true regret.  “So much confusion reigned immediately following the Battle of Butchers, that his body was never recovered by our forces.  No, what you hold was worn bravely by the hand of your mother.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh imagined her mother’s hand sliding into the magnificent gauntlet in preparation for that momentous battle so many years before.  The memories she held of her mother were fragmented and distorted, for the most part, as the duties of a shadow knight precluded any domestic considerations – including those of parenting.  Holding this coveted possession of hers brought back old, forgotten memories in a rush.  Feelings of those few occasions when her mother was still alive flooded Dreketh’s mind. <br>
<br>
Looking back inside the crate, Dreketh noticed a gaping hole in the otherwise complete set of armor, tucked carefully within the moldings.<br>
<br>
“Wait…” she said, reaching in to fish around amongst the contents.  “I don’t see a breastplate.”<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill swallowed softly.<br>
<br>
“No,” he said sadly as he resumed his seat at the foot of the bed.  “You won’t find one.  You see, it was the one piece of her armor that was unsalvageable.”<br>
<br>
Gingerly returning the gauntlet to its place inside the crate, Dreketh faced him, a look of dismayed uncertainty on her face.<br>
<br>
Wetting his lips, Quexill prepared himself.  He had known that soon after he delivered Dreketh’s birthright that she would notice the missing piece and ask him about it.  For years, he had known this moment would come, but the knowing didn’t make it any easier.  Squaring his shoulders, he began to tell his pupil the bitter details surrounding her parents’ deaths, or at least what he knew.<br>
<br>
“After the struggle at the Battle of Butchers was over and a stalemate declared on both sides, the soldiers began to wade their burdensome march through the bodies of the dead – or nearly dead – that littered the battlefield.  As they went about their gruesome task of collecting the bodies of their fallen comrades, a downpour ensued.  Rain fell from the skies in a torrential deluge, as if the gods, too, wished to cleanse the land of the carnage.<br>
<br>
“Through the foul mists, the soldiers eventually came upon the body of your mother.  She had apparently tracked off to a secluded area, probably having chased some cowardly scout into the brush.  She lay resplendent in her armor – the very armor in this case.  With the exception of a dent or gash here and there, it remained unscathed, for the most part.  All except her breastplate, which was evidenced to have collapsed under the repeated beating of some enormous hammer.”<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill interlaced his hands rigidly.<br>
<br>
“No,” he continued, his voice tense with revulsion.  “Not repeatedly.  Relentlessly.  The battered and broken shards of her breastplate mingled in the strewn, gruesome remains of her viscera.  The relatively untouched condition of the rest of her armor and the spread-eagled position of her corpse suggested not a massive battle, but a futile struggle in her part.”<br>
<br>
Quexill stopped suddenly to stare into his pupil’s horrified gaze.<br>
<br>
“What met their eyes – what made hardened knights and warriors retch was not the result of war,” he shook his head slowly.  “But a gruesome, detestable display of murder.”<br>
<br>
Standing suddenly, Quexill retrieved the gauntlet from within the crate.  Holding it before him, his voice rose angrily as he spoke.<br>
<br>
“The finery of her armor tells of its craftsmanship – even your newly trained eye sees this as being plainly obvious.  It would have taken at least fifty swings of an ogre with the mightiest hammer to do what was done.  Fifty… telling… swings, Dreketh.” Quexill spoke succinctly, and paused to let that fact sink in.  “No battle is that heated.  There is no doubt in my mind that a band of despicable cowards held your mother helpless to the ground as she was pummeled over and over until her breastplate simply gave, and then she was pummeled even further… until she died.”<br>
<br>
Losing his ardor, the necromancer let the hand holding the gauntlet drop to his side.  Hanging his head slightly, Quexill spoke with the finality of one defeated.<br>
<br>
“This is why you were taken into my custody as a necromancer.  Unable to explain why it happened specifically to your mother, Nezzka Tolax questioned the wisdom of taking you into his guild for fear history may repeat itself.  He therefore tried to save you from this fate by petitioning me on your behalf, and on behalf of two of his fallen knights.”<br>
<br>
Standing, Dreketh approached the crate as if stalking a ghoul.  Placing her hand delicately on the lip of the opening, she stared down at the armor within, the mark of livid calm across her face.  Polished and flawless, the armor winked back up at her.  She could almost see it the way it was that day, amidst the mud and the splashing rain as both mingled together with her mother’s blood.  She could nearly hear her mother’s cries as each blow fell, slowly breaking down the robust bronze plate bit by bit, bringing the pain of death closer by inches.  <br>
<br>
“One thing more,” came Xon Quexill’s voice, breaking the deathly silence.  Reaching into the crate, hidden between the moldings and the wooden side, he drew forth a sword nearly as tall as she.  Crafted of the finest steel, it too gleamed as the light of her room bounced off it in a myriad of reflections.<br>
<br>
“This was found clutched securely in your mother’s hand,” he said with reverence.  “It belonged to your father and his lineage.  How it left his side and found its way into your mother’s possession remains a mystery.”<br>
<br>
Placing her supple hands upon the hilt, Dreketh gently lifted the sword from the necromancer’s grip.  Her placid eyes took in its every detail as she turned it over.<br>
<br>
“I hardly knew my mother.  My father even less,” she muttered, still inspecting the blade with wondering eyes.  “Some malevolent force out there has left me bereft of this privilege every child should have.”<br>
<br>
Turning her head with a deadly grace, she faced her mentor with a look of grim resolve.  Xon Quexill saw that he was witness to the emergence of something he had never seen in Dreketh until that moment.  Inside the mind of his young girl now dwelt the spirit of an adult woman – a strong Teir’Dal female bent on placing her mark on the world.  <br>
<br>
What happened next came as no surprise to the master necromancer.  Dreketh took a firm hold of the sword by its hilt with her right hand.  Her clear eyes falling to a deepening shade of blue, she spoke.<br>
<br>
“By the blood of my mother, and with my father’s blade, I swear vengeance toward that which stole their lives.”  Bringing her father’s sword to bear on her left arm, she sliced a clean incision from which welled a crimson stain.  Her own blood marred the blade and tunic alike.  “So witness, Innoruuk, this vow of hatred.”<br>
<br>
“So witnessed.”  Xon Quexill’s voice spoke deep and solemn.  Placing his hand atop Dreketh’s shoulder, his face shown overwhelmed with pride in his protégé.  “Go forth at the appointed hour, daughter, and fulfill His Pact, and your own.  I wish to say my farewells now, as I shan’t be present when you leave.  My journey is long and wearisome, and so must embark upon it tonight.”<br>
<br>
Feeling more herself now that this ordeal was done with, she looked up at him with concern shadowing her features.  After being the recipient of such a shocking legacy, all she wanted to do was curl up in her master’s comforting arms like a babe.  Looking into Quexill’s eyes, she saw the similar feelings tinged with an unspoken regret that it wasn’t to be so.<br>
<br>
“I wish you could stay,” she pleaded solemnly, knowing her efforts to be fruitless.<br>
<br>
“As do I, child, but I’m afraid it is unavoidable,” he spoke with sincere lament.  <br>
<br>
His hand still placed on her shoulder, he tilted his head to take note of the bloodstain inexorably spreading across the damaged sleeve.  Blinking, Quexill moved his hand down to her midriff, taking the smooth fabric in his grasp. <br>
<br>
“Might I keep this?”  He asked plaintively.<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked down at the unremarkable cloth tunic she wore, curious why he should make such a request.  Her oath in no way sanctified the article of clothing.  Its pattern was wholly nondescript – it held no real value other than, perhaps, that it was worn by his surrogate daughter.  Seeing no reason why he shouldn’t keep it as a memento of her oath, Dreketh shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Certainly,” she said as she unlaced the drawstrings crisscrossing at her chest.  <br>
<br>
Favoring her injured arm only slightly, Dreketh reached up behind her neck and drew the tunic over her head, placing it into the hands of her mentor.  Now exposed, the fresh cut shown plainly against the healthy curvature of her arm muscles, a small trickle of blood blending purple against her blue skin.<br>
<br>
Carefully hefting the breezy fabric wadded loosely in his hand, Quexill regarded it as though he held a king’s ransom.<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” he said with an appreciative smile.<br>
<br>
“Sure, my pleasure,” Dreketh shrugged offhandedly.  She flourished her hands wide at the clothes strewn  all about her quarters.  “I have plenty of others I can tear up for your safe-keeping…”<br>
<br>
“No, no.  This is quite enough.”  Quexill smiled, gazing fondly at the young shadow knight.<br>
<br>
Fondness quickly turned earnest, however, as he broached the most serious subject he had ever discussed with his pupil throughout the years.<br>
<br>
“Don’t underestimate the importance of Zeranon’s Pact, Dreketh,” he said ominously.  “The task you undertake tomorrow as you leave is vital, and must not be broken.  You must guard and protect your companion against any threat.  Should either of you be killed, all will be lost.”<br>
<br>
For the first time since entering her room, Quexill heard Dreketh speak of the Pact without any hint of her well-practiced resentment.<br>
<br>
“I know,” she nodded solemnly.  “I don’t understand any of this or why I’m doing it.”  Taking her mentor’s virile hand in hers, she placed his palm to her chest, over her heart.  “But as long as you say it is important, I will do it without question.  It is for you I willingly accept this task -- not for N’Threk or Tolax or even the Teir’Dal.  I only pray that this path Innoruuk has seen fit to place me on crosses the throats of my parents’ murderers on the way.”<br>
<br>
In holding with the traditional Teir’Dal gesture of sincerity, Xon Quexill could feel the steady pounding of Dreketh’s heart inside her chest.  The reassuring heat of her skin against his palm nearly brought tears to the eyes of the hardened necromancer.  Removing his hand, Quexill mindlessly adjusted the strap of her undershirt to rest untwisted against her shoulder, as would any doting father.<br>
<br>
Taking Dreketh’s hand, he enshrouded it in the tender grasp of both his own. <br>
<br>
“Goodbye, my daughter,” Quexill spoke in a choked whisper.  His gaze upon their joined hands never wavered.  “I’ll leave you now to your preparations.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you for all you have done for me, father,” she spoke in a smooth tone, seeing his distress.  Craning her neck, Dreketh placed a gentle kiss on his cheek.<br>
<br>
Nodding his goodbye, Quexill patted his child’s hand one last time before he turned to walk hurriedly through her doorway, disappearing out of sight down the hall.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Far off beyond the haze of Greater Faydark, the sun made its gradual descent across the western sky, bringing a close to yet another day.  The only hint of its presence to the murky woodland was the filtered rays that shown ambient in the mist.  Nevertheless, Kelethin’s inhabitants instinctively knew of the night’s imminent approach.  One by one, the windows amid the lofty network of platforms and bridges high above the forest floor winked on, aglow from lamplight within.  The combined efforts of Kelethin’s lights had the effect of rivaling the teeming glow of the fireflies below as they too celebrated night’s approach.<br>
<br>
Like gigantic beasts dipping their heads to graze upon the dewy landscape, the tremendous Kelethin lifts rose and fell slowly with majestic grace, carrying Kelethin’s inhabitants down to the forest floor and back again. As the only means of entering or leaving the city high above, the immense mechanical lifts were almost constantly in use during daytime hours.  <br>
<br>
As the onset of night approached, however, lift traffic waned with the daylight.  The occasional late-comer to the tree city would make an appearance out of the hazy darkness from time to time.  Waving a slovenly hand to the guards on watch, the new arrival would plunge the attentive lever close by to activate the lift.  Had they not typically been so weary-eyed by their nighttime journey, the late-comer would see the forest floor falling into obscurity below them as the lift made its lengthy ascent higher and higher into the treetops.<br>
<br>
Those few late arrivals that evening saw something that wasn’t normally seen every night upon arriving at the top of one particular lift.  As they disembarked, an unassuming cloaked figure stood off to the left.  While not entirely unusual to see the random night dweller among Kelethin’s citizens on their way out of the city, this figure had an unnerving aspect.  As a rule, most figures standing at the head of the lift would immediately step on to the plank and waste no time in beginning their journey down.  Those who didn’t were expected to beg for a hand-out of some sort, with which to line their presumably empty pockets.  This individual made no such gestures.  She merely stood motionless, her face lost in the folds of her hood, calmly looking out into the darkening night of the forest.  <br>
<br>
One would question that she was even alive, were it not for the billowing clouds of her breath emerging from within her hood out into the chilled air.  Those curious onlookers may have made a half-hearted attempt to see what it was that so enraptured her attention out among the trees and the rolling mists.  Seeing nothing but the same forest that was there yesterday, the onlooker would shrug and go about their business.<br>
<br>
Laera continued her relentless watch, however, for it was the forest itself that caught her attention so raptly.  Just beyond the mists of the darkening shadows lay the world she was about to enter.  A part of her was leaping for joy at this opportunity to serve Tunare and take Her work to other lands.  Deep inside, every Wood Elf heard the call of their innate wanderlust, and usually answered its call at least once at some point in their lives.  Laera was no different.<br>
<br>
At the same time, she felt melancholy at the idea of leaving her homeland behind.  As a child, she had explored Greater Faydark as a roving pet might explore its owner’s yard.  It was her playground.  She knew where to discover all its wonders and how to avoid all its dangers.  It was her home – the only home she had ever known.  It harbored special places full of her dreams and old childhood memories.<br>
<br>
Casting her mind back, Laera thought about how simple those days were when the slaying of a dastardly dragon meant swinging a wooden sword against the trunk of a sapling.  She remembered when being a damsel in distress meant not being able to leave a cluster of bushes until her rescuer came to unlock her pretend prison with a pretend key.  <br>
<br>
The little girl who once played her games of imagination and adventure stood now, grown and fully mature, on the brink of a new adventure.  Only this time the dragons fought back, and the prison bars didn’t magically disappear when it was suppertime.  Now the damsels in distress had far more threatening them than merely being locked in towers, and not every story ended in “happily ever after.”<br>
<br>
Visions of memory wandered through Laera’s mind as she stared out upon the towering woods of her home, pondering.  Greater Faydark was so many things to her.  She had the oddest impression that she was saying goodbye to a treasured playmate.  While she would certainly be returning from time to time in her travels, she doubted very much if she would be seeing it in the same way ever again.  Old friends and old times can be revisited, but nostalgia can never truly recapture the past.<br>
<br>
She heard his footsteps approach from behind.  Even from within the muffling folds of her hood, the eerie silence of the night had a way of amplifying every sound.  Consequently, she’d heard him coming the moment his feet stepped from the bridge far off on the other side of the platform.  The shuffling noises of his stride were unmistakable as they came to a halt not more than a few feet away.  The time had come to end her goodbyes to a treasured playmate, only to say her goodbyes to a treasured friend.<br>
<br>
“Thank you for coming, Rigel,” her muttered words spoke softly.<br>
<br>
Rigel wanted to give some hearty, glib response.  He had planned this moment out in his head countless times since their all-too-brief reunion the previous night, but now for some reason his voice refused to cooperate.  His expression turning painfully acerbic, he could only lock his gaze on the back of his friend’s hood and stand there in silence.<br>
<br>
“I really don’t know if I could have left without saying goodbye one last time,” Laera added, the sentence conjured to fill the void of silence, more than anything.  Having heard her own voice speak the words, she was mildly surprised to discover how true they were.<br>
<br>
Rigel smiled slightly to himself, as much as his current mood allowed.<br>
<br>
“Then I’m almost sorry I came,” he said, his voice laced with a hint of sarcasm.<br>
<br>
Her own face grinning solemnly within the shade of her hood, Laera continued facing the forest.  This was harder than she thought it was going to be.  She thanked Tunare that it would have to be short, as time was quickly growing thin.<br>
<br>
“I have something for you,” Rigel spoke, clearing his throat to break the tension.<br>
<br>
“And I you,” Laera said in a deliberately brisk tone.  Turning, she expected to see Rigel holding out some trinket to remember him by – perhaps a locket or earring of some sort.  To her surprise, Rigel stood before her, hefting a large sack over one shoulder.<br>
<br>
The surprise must have been evident on her face, judging by Rigel’s smug grin.  Swinging the bag from his shoulder, he let it fall with a solid thump to the wooden planks at his feet.<br>
<br>
“I made this for you,” he said, unstrapping the drawstrings.  “I actually started on it a few of months ago as a graduation gift.”<br>
<br>
Laera drew back her hood, now suddenly curious as to what the gift could possibly be.  To her knowledge, Rigel harbored no artisan skills nor had he shown any desire to pursue them.  At least, he had never let on as such.  The hesitant thought crossed her mind that he may have fixed her a travelling meal for the journey, which made her wince inwardly – Rigel’s cooking habits were affectionately called “Ogre Culinary Delights” by the other acolytes.<br>
<br>
Reaching into the sack, Rigel pulled forth a rigid, unrecognizable article of leather.  Allowing the sides of the bag to fall, he concentrated on working the item with both hands until he held before his friend a beautiful tunic, complete with rabbit fur lining and embroidered with the caducal symbol of the druids.<br>
<br>
Laera covered her mouth momentarily in a quick draw of breath.  Reaching out gingerly, she ran her fingers down the front of the armor, taking in its curved shape.  Seeing not the work of a neophyte, but the quality work of a competent tailor, she looked to her friend with genuine awe.<br>
<br>
“You made this?” she asked incredulously.<br>
<br>
Rigel shrugged his silent, nonchalant response.  It could have been the royal breastplate of Antonius Bayle himself, and he would have had the same modest disposition.<br>
<br>
“It’s wonderful,” she claimed, returning her eyes to the armor.  “I had no idea you knew how to tailor.”<br>
<br>
“I decided to learn,” he responded.  “I had to pick a trade skill to study, and tailoring seemed more appropriate than basket-weaving.  A lot of it I had to get help from the tutor for, like the lining and steel reinforcements underneath.”<br>
<br>
The wonderment never left Laera’s eyes.  Taking the tunic from her friend’s hands, she turned it about and ran her fingers through the softness of the rabbit fur lining.  Normally, patchwork made by a novice would feel laden and pinched while worn, often making the wearer begin to question whether the armor was worth all the trouble of wearing it.  Her fingers found that the fur lining against the rigid curves rid the tunic of any such discomfort.  Breathless, she held the tunic up to her robed torso, experimentally.<br>
<br>
 “Will this fit?  How did you know my size?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“It should,” he said, his head tilted as he critiqued his own work before him.  “The buckles here and here can be adjusted to fit your, uhm… your figure, and t-the size was-“<br>
<br>
Laera glanced up at hearing his hesitation.<br>
<br>
“Well,” Rigel said, blushing.  “Let’s… just say the size is easy if you’re paying close enough attention.”<br>
<br>
Laera blinked, unsure about what she was hearing.  Though his words themselves were plainly innocent in nature, it seemed by his manner as if Rigel were making a confession of sorts.  She could clearly see that what he said somehow embarrassed him.<br>
<br>
Narrowing her eyes, she gave him a searching look, noting his uneasiness.  Was he saying what she thought he was saying?  Yes… she could see it in his expression and the way he fidgeted with his hands nervously.  She became amazed as she realized he couldn’t look her in the face.  How could this be?  Her first thought was that this couldn’t be happening.  Her second was that this couldn’t be happening right now!<br>
<br>
“Rigel, I-“ she said, brokenly.  What does one say at a time like this, she lamented.  Rigel had always been like a little brother to her.  What had happened?  How long had he felt this way?  Did he just discover his feelings, or had he been hiding them for some time?  A mass of ambivalence swept over Laera as she tried to figure out how she, herself, felt on such short notice.<br>
<br>
“I, um…” Rigel looked about, self-consciously.  “I better get back to the, uh…the…thing.”  He nervously thumbed over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
Laera grabbed hold of the tunic against herself with one arm, while reaching out to halt Rigel’s hasty retreat with the other.<br>
<br>
“No, wait!” she burst out, desperate to keep him there long enough for her to collect her thoughts.<br>
<br>
Of all the things life had thrown her way in the past few weeks, this was the most unexpected.  After having made this discovery about her friend, it seemed inevitable that such feelings were bound to have emerged.  In a purely detached way, it was the obvious next step in their relationship.  How could she not have seen it?  She had to wonder if she was emotionally blind or solely stupid.  Even more disturbing, why hadn’t similar feelings already emerged in her?  She loved Rigel dearly, she had always known that, but this was altogether different.  The idea of attraction or even passion between them was somehow alien to her.  While not exactly an unwelcome notion now that it presented itself, it was something that simply hadn’t crossed her mind before.<br>
<br>
To whatever consequence, the notion was certainly laid bare and had to be dealt with – all in the span of time it takes to say goodbye.  Not only was it unfair that she had only a few moments in which to search her soul, but it was wholly unfair that whatever her feelings were, it had to end once those precious few moments were over.  <br>
<br>
It wasn’t enough time, no matter how she looked at it.  Rigel had had months to decide how he felt.  As much as she wanted to give it the honest chance it deserved, Laera knew it would be impossible for her to develop the same feelings in this blink of time.  Not only that, but whatever feelings she might have fostered and allowed to grow could never see fruition.  <br>
<br>
So much had happened recently that was unfair.  Until now, Laera had accepted everything that had been sent her way with equanimity, dealing with it all as best she could.  With silent devotion to her goddess and her calling, Laera had maintained a reserved grip on any feelings of bitterness she may have felt.  Unbeknownst to her, those feelings were held tightly pent up inside, now ready to burst with this new shining addition to their number.<br>
<br>
With mixed feelings of sorrow, fear, love and now sheer unfocused resentment, Laera made her decision of how to handle the moment, since the moment was apparently all she had left.  She chose to forget the world and its gods and its holy quests for one perfect glimpse of time.  Laera turned her back on it all to live in that glimpse alone.  <br>
<br>
The leather tunic fell to the wooden floor.  In a single motion, she reached for the back of Rigel’s neck and swiftly brought her lips to bear against his.  <br>
<br>
Taken aback by her sudden move, his limbs froze in place.  As his thoughts eventually cleared, and he could feel the inviting warmth of her lips against his, Rigel gradually reached out and crept his hands up her robe-covered back, enveloping her in his arms.  <br>
<br>
Her kiss was unlike anything he had ever envisioned.  He could feel the deluge of her emotions in its rapture,  the impassioned, urgent feel of her lips against his.  He felt her hand running through the hair on the back of his head, the small movements of her lithe form nestled in his embrace.  Rigel experienced it all in a rush as he shared Laera’s perfect glimpse of time.<br>
<br>
All such moments are transitory, however, and hers was soon to end.  Releasing her tight hold on him, Laera raised her eyelids and slowly disengaged their kiss.  Looking into Rigel’s eyes, she silently let him see all of what that moment meant to her.<br>
<br>
Separating from her would-be lover, Laera reached down to pick up the tunic.  <br>
<br>
“Thank you,” she whispered, reaching out a tender hand to caress his cheek in one final touch.<br>
<br>
Knowing that the moment of her departure was at hand, Rigel could only stand motionless.<br>
<br>
Turning, Laera stepped onto the lift plank and plunged its lever.  With the cold, unfeeling motions of the heartless, uncaring machine that it was, the mechanism activated and began its steady descent to the ground, taking its forlorn passenger with it.  <br>
<br>
Sinking relentlessly, Laera looked up at Rigel as he gradually became obscured by the platform upon which he stood.  Her eyes rising higher and higher, meeting his, she saw that he understood everything she felt, and shared them in return.   Never in her life had she heard of a romance that was so short-lived.  Maintaining a tight hold on her tears, she watched as Rigel’s face disappeared behind the wooden planks of the platform.<br>
<br>
The most recent chapter in her life was now closed, and a new one began.<br>
<br>
Reaching the forest ground at last, Laera wasted no time in mounting her burrow, waiting laden with supplies for the journey.  The accompanying night watch guard dutifully handed her the bridle with a gauntleted hand.<br>
<br>
“Any last minute affairs, miss?” he asked, a standard rhetoric the guard made to those departing the city.<br>
<br>
Glancing sharply at the guard, Laera’s expression hardened.<br>
<br>
“No,” she lied.  “None at all.”<br>
<br>
“Good journey to you, then,” the guard said, returning to his accustomed post.<br>
<br>
Laera prodded the beast into moving ahead onto the path leading to Felwithe.  From there, she was to move on to Butcherblock Mountains, and from there abroad to the continent of Antonica.  She felt the endless miles separating her from Kelethin as if she were already there.<br>
<br>
Turning back for one last glimpse of her beloved home, Laera saw a familiar silhouette – his silhouette – standing where she left him, framed by the burning glow of the torchlight above.  Now that she was alone under cover of the darkness, what once she had under strict control fell apart in a sudden outpouring of emotion.  Through her tears Laera could see Rigel raise his hand solemnly in farewell moments before the platform, the lift, the light, and his figure were all lost among the leaves gathering densely overhead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Outside the great cave entrance to the Teir’Dal city of Neriak emerged a small, lone figure.  Dressed resplendent in shining bronze plate – complete except for a curiously absent breastplate, which was substituted by ordinary leather.  The figure marched away with a brisk stride.  Though the missing piece of armor would seem odd, even comical, on any other warrior, the figure wore it with an air of befitting pride as she made her relentless way into the heart of Nektulos Forest.<br>
<br>
The Pact of Zeranon had begun.<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 4 - Forget Me Not</c><br>
<br>
Dearest Laera,<br>
<br>
I don’t know what you would think of this letter, or even of someone who writes a letter that will never be delivered.  All I know is that there are some things I need to say to you that could never be spoken, and some things I need to get straight in my own head before I can press on with my life.  This letter seemed the best way of doing that.<br>
<br>
First of all, I feel the need to say that I truly have no idea what happened to my feelings, or when.  Come to think of it, I probably fell in love with you from the day we met and it took time for me to finally realize it.  Somehow, over the months of our friendship, you managed to capture my heart, and it just sneaked up on me.  By the time I realized my feelings, it was too late to do anything.  I couldn’t say anything to you about it.  I don’t know why.  Call it shyness or whatever.  Believe me, I tried on many occasions to say or do something that would let you know, but every time I tried, something inside stopped me.  I suppose it was mostly because of our friendship that I relented.<br>
<br>
I know that sounds stupid, but it’s the only way I can explain it.  You’re such a sweet, kind-hearted person, and I valued our friendship so much, I couldn’t bring myself to do anything that could threaten that.  You have to admit, had I told you about my feelings and discovered that they weren’t mutual, our friendship would never have been the same again.  I’m sure you could see that.<br>
<br>
In a way, I’m glad you figured it out on the day you left for your journey.  I think deep down inside I wanted you to figure it out.  I just couldn’t say it in words.  Sitting here now I realize that, despite my best efforts, our friendship will never be the same now anyway.  The cruelty of life’s irony is truly bitter. <br>
<br>
Most of all, I wanted you to know that I understand everything, now.  <br>
<br>
I understand why you had to leave.  I don’t know what you’re being asked to do, but I can see it is extremely important to all of us and our future.  I can also see how hard it is for you to carry through with it.  To be honest, I don’t know that I’d have the faith to perform the things you’re doing.  As far as the future goes, I don’t know what to think.  My instincts tell me that the immediate future is fraught with danger – particularly if your suspicions of the Teir’Dal are true.  But I do know that if the right thing must be done for us all, you are the correct one to do it.  I truly believe you are a chosen soul of Tunare (I always did), and that you rest in Her caring hand as you go forth.<br>
<br>
I understand , too, that you have no choice in what you’re doing.  During your absence, a part of me wondered if somehow you chose to turn away from me and everyone else.  I tried to think of what I might have said or done to drive you away.  Please know that I do understand now that what you’re doing is necessary and completely out of any of our control.  With this in mind, I’ve seriously considered turning my back on everything here in Kelethin and sneaking off after you.  But when I envision the look on your face when I show up on your doorstep, I immediately shrink back from that idea.  I know it’s something you’d never allow, and would probably escort me back to Kelethin, dragging me by the ear the whole way.  The last thing I would ever want from you is your disappointment, so here I will remain.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I understand your kiss.  You probably don’t know this, because I never told you before, but I had never been kissed before that night at the lift.  It seems kind of silly for a Wood Elf my age never to have been kissed before, doesn’t it?  Well, it’s not exactly something I announced freely to everyone.  Now, thanks to you, it’s no longer something I have to hide or feel lousy about.  All that aside, I do understand what it was and what it meant, and I accept it without regret or reservation.<br>
<br>
Along those lines, I have come to grips with the fact that you and I were never truly meant to be.  In all likelihood, you are destined for someone else, and I must learn to accept it.  Looking forward, I can see myself eventually doing just that.  I really have no choice, but right now it’s not easy for me.  As selfish as it sounds, every time I imagine you in the arms of someone else, my heart sinks clear through the ground.  They say time heals all wounds.  Well, I hope they’re right.  Even so, I think it will take large cartloads of it to heal mine.  I’m not trying to be melodramatic, here.  Just honest.<br>
<br>
I don’t know what I’m going to do now that the time has come to move on, but I’m thinking it will be something profound and totally out-of-character for me.  Lately I haven’t felt like being myself.  I’m not sure why, but I feel like taking a vacation from who I am – for a while, at least.  We’ll see what happens.  I’m still exploring my options here at the school.<br>
<br>
I guess that’s about all I have to say.  Well, everything except what I probably should have told you a long time ago, but will never get the chance to say: I love you.  Of all the uncertainty in the world and its foreboding future, that is one thing I can say without question.  I love you, Laera Nellynwae.  I love you now, and I always will – come what may.<br>
<br>
Thank you for all you have given me, and for being the best friend anyone could ever have.  May Tunare bless you and keep you in all things, and may you return home from your journey with success and honor in Her name.<br>
<br>
Your truest friend,<br>
<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 5 - Worlds Collide</c><br>
<br>
At first glimpse, one would think the seemingly peaceful East Commonlands of Antonica would offer an idyllic lifestyle for its inhabitants.  Amid a wide variety of trees and hills and gullies, the land provided a bountiful setting where survival meant deciding which of fruit to pick or what kind of meat to hunt that day.  Aside from a few tiny collections of orcish clans who set up camp nearby and the occasional griffin hunting its way through the area, the East Commonlands presented what appeared on the surface to be an ideal spot to enjoy. <br>
<br>
Such delusions were quickly put to rest by its nearby inhabitants, however.  With the Teir’Dal nation resting in the heart of Nektulos Forest to the north, and the Human occupation of Freeport to the east, the East Commonlands often became the focus of contention between the two peoples.  As such, the picturesque nature of the lush landscape was stained by years of blood as the two nations feuded.  Instead of living a life of peaceful contentment, the Commonlanders were subject to the mightier powers of their warring neighbors.  Their home often became battleground to what they saw as a futile struggle they had little or no stake in.<br>
<br>
And that’s not to mention the flotsam of bizarre creatures that filtered in from the more hazardous West Commonlands.  <br>
<br>
Although their numbers were largely Human, the inhabitants of the Commonlands  held no official loyalties to the teeming stronghold of Freeport, contrary to whatever militia presence one might observe from time to time.  Truth be known, they would much rather they and their homeland be forgotten by Human and Teir’Dal alike, and left alone to their own devices.  In a perfect world, such a thing might have been possible.<br>
<br>
But Norrath was not a perfect world, so the inhabitants of the Commonlands decided to make the best of their situation and chose to tolerate outsiders and offer them open trade.  If others insisted on intruding upon their lands on their way to and from Freeport, then they might as well benefit and even prosper from their circumstances.  <br>
<br>
Such tolerance ended, however, when it came to the Teir’Dal, whose hateful and malicious eyes had been focused on the East Commonlands for quite some time.  Should the Dark Elves of Neriak ever succeed in conquering the rich lands, they would finally have the resources to launch their killing blow to the city-state of Freeport.  And from there, who knew?  The Commonlanders didn’t much care, to be perfectly frank.  All they knew was that their precious territory would wither and die under Dark Elf rule, and strove to thwart any such possibility.<br>
<br>
The East Commonlands also had its share of the more seedy elements of Humankind.  Thieves and bandits occasionally reaped what they could from their circumstances as well.  So successful were they, in fact, that they literally controlled passage into the mighty Desert of Ro to the south.<br>
<br>
Long ago in times forgotten by most, a tunnel had been built that breached the otherwise impassible desert wall separating the Commonlands from the vast desert.  It was within this tunnel and its lofty caverns that the less desirable members of the community gathered.  Together they met and rallied to barter and banter amongst themselves, catering to anyone with gold or silver regardless of race or creed – including the Teir’Dal.  Money was money and they recognized its value – be it honest or stolen, held in hands pale or ebony, green or blue.  Race and motive never mattered, so long as the money was good.<br>
<br>
Though their presence stuck in the craw of many of the locals, they were allowed to go about their business deep inside the tunnel so long as that was where they remained.  Word quickly spread about the finery of the weapons and items that could be had for a price, and eventually the small rough-and-tumble cave community entered into their own thriving enterprise in the black market.  It became well known among the local commonwealth – though less often spoken – that if you wanted the best of the underground, you literally went underground to find it.  What began as a hideout for brigands and hoodlums became a commonly-known lawless crossroads for people from all walks of life.<br>
<br>
Dreketh found the place to her liking.  Resting beneath a makeshift lean-to near the entrance, she calmly observed as Human and Dark Elf bartered and traded together in the most unofficial capacity they could.  She even noted the occasional Halfling making their way amidst the haphazard bazaar, their small voices piping as they sold their own goods imported from their homeland of Rivervale to the northwest.  Dreketh marveled at knowing that once these people left the cavern, they would magically become bitter enemies again.  It astonished her how the all-powerful platinum could erase any boundary, given the right circumstances.<br>
<br>
The cavern was the perfect place to meet her companion.  For all his shortcomings – and they were many – she had to hand it to Kella N’Threk.  He had chosen the ideal spot where a rendezvous between a Dark Elf and a light dweller would go unquestioned.  No need for sneaking about or for secret meeting places.  They could conduct their business completely in the open, and nobody would give them a second look or have cause to be suspicious of their actions.<br>
<br>
As the hushed tones of the occupants wafted about the cavern, Dreketh wondered which one was her contact.  Try as she might, she couldn’t pry loose any specifics about her counterpart beyond the fact that it was a light dweller and she would recognize them immediately.  Nothing about race or occupation.  She didn’t even know if she should be expecting a male or female.  The doddering old priest was just too vague to pry any useful information out of.<br>
<br>
Her eyes searching among the small groups of patrons, Dreketh caught herself privately hoping it would be a male Human.  Though she had always been taught to hate light dwellers of every race, the handful of Human men who were allowed to reside in Neriak’s foreign quarter always managed to catch her eye.  Their physiques were very much unlike any Dark Elf male, with much stronger muscles and powerful catlike grace.  They were considerably taller, and often grew thick beards – something of a challenge for the males of her kind.  If she had to spend her time with a light dweller day in and day out, she wished for at least that much, just to make life tolerable.  Who knows?  Perhaps she could reap some small amount of pleasure along the way.<br>
<br>
Sighing, Dreketh adjusted her bronze leggings.  Though fine to wear while standing or walking, they annoyed her to no end while sitting – particularly on the floor, as she was.  She fervently wished she could divest them right there while she waited.  Unfortunately, their snug fit didn’t allow room for anything thicker than her undergarments beneath them.  With all these ruffians about, she decided it was best not to attract undue attention – not to mention any misleading ideas from the lonelier of the men.  <br>
<br>
Hours passed in the relative darkness of the cavern.  During her patient tarry, Dreketh waved off the occasional merchant offering some trinket or other, purchasing only a handful of rations to tide her over until her contact showed.  She wasn’t certain how long her wait was going to be and wondered idly if she should look into whatever room and board this place offered, if any.  Chewing absently on a bland morsel, she craned her neck to see if there might be any pallets she could rent for the day.<br>
<br>
That was when she saw the robed figure make its way through the gaping cavern entrance.  Though certainly not an unusual sight in the underground agora, this particular figure had the look of having never graced this place before, nor any like it.  Glancing promptly among the patrons, the person was obviously looking for something in particular.  <br>
<br>
Or someone.<br>
<br>
Dreketh paid close attention to the newcomer.  Whoever they may be, they were slight of build beneath the concealing robes, which were of a curious design she had never seen before.  This person was obviously not Human, as their height was no greater than that of a Dark Elf, but a good two heads taller than any dwarf.  Slung over the figure’s shoulder was a pack that had the look of having traveled a fair distance.  The figure had a habit of shying away from any passers by, evidently loath to have anything to do with the occupants of this place – certainly not the behavior of someone looking to do a bit of midnight browsing.  <br>
<br>
Which begged the question why the individual decided to come here in the first place.  Either this was some homebody come to retrieve a spouse or sibling, or…<br>
<br>
The figure withdrew its cowling hood, revealing the sharp, refined features of a Wood Elf female from the far east continent of Faydwer.  The torchlight reflected the flawless chestnut complexion, surrounded by wisps of straight auburn hair that reached to her shoulders.  Running her fingers through her hair, the Wood Elf made an impassive attempt at fixing the unkempt wisps that had become tousled in the folds of the hood, all the while her gaze darting here and there about the cavern.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s expression darkened even as she sat staring.  Though the sight of a Wood Elf this close to Freeport was not entirely unusual, they typically kept to themselves and they never graced such places as this with their presence.  Had she stumbled across this loathsome creature out and away from the tunnel, she would already have been sliding her sword from the bleeding corpse.  As it was, she knew the regulars at this place enforced a strict code of non-violence, and any upstarts were dealt with quickly and ruthlessly.<br>
<br>
That didn’t mean Dreketh couldn’t show this abomination the depth of her repugnance.  She merely sat, her seething eyes glaring a hole straight into the Wood Elf.  <br>
<br>
By whatever foul sixth sense that Wood Elves seemed to possess, the female somehow felt Dreketh’s burning gaze and turned her searching eyes to gaze her way.  Their eyes met in the same way lightning meets the ground.  Several bystanders who passed between them even stopped suddenly and looked from one to the other to see what it was they had inadvertently blundered upon.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s uncertain gaze wavered, as if she were reluctant about something.  Dreketh silently willed her to draw a weapon or make a move to attack – that way the market’s patrons would do her work for her.  It wouldn’t be as satisfying, but at least she wouldn’t have to look at those nauseatingly whimsical Wood Elf features anymore.<br>
<br>
Blinking, the Wood Elf made her soft-footed approach toward Dreketh.  Great.  Now what did she want?  Couldn’t she see plainly enough that she was unwelcome?  Go back to your little homeland, woodie, Dreketh shouted in her mind.  My people will deal with your kind soon enough.<br>
<br>
Approaching Dreketh, the Wood Elf leaned down to speak, her look filled with apprehension.<br>
<br>
“My name is Laera Nellynwae.  I come to fulfill the Pact of Zeranon,” she said in a small voice.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s disposition transformed from ire to shock.  The Pact of Zeranon.  It couldn’t be.  Her gaze unwavering, Dreketh stood to face this obvious imposter.<br>
<br>
“No,” she said simply.<br>
<br>
Laera’s expression turned quizzical.  <br>
<br>
“I’m sorry?” she asked, turning her head slightly as if she hadn’t heard correctly.<br>
<br>
“Who are you that you know of Zeranon’s Pact?”  Dreketh practically spat the words.<br>
<br>
“I… just told you,” Laera replied, warily confused at the question.  “I am Laera Nellynwae.  I have come to fulfill the Pact of-“<br>
<br>
“And I said no!” Dreketh’s shout caught the attention of several patrons nearby.  Glancing around, she lowered her voice.  “N’Threk would never expect me to go off with some puny Wood Elf child.  So you’d better start telling me who you really are and how you know about the Pact.”<br>
<br>
Laera had expected a certain amount of friction to take place once she caught up with the Dark Elf emissary.  She anticipated a great deal of tension, as she figured neither of them would be thrilled at the prospect of traveling together.  But outright denial was something she wasn’t prepared to deal with.  This person was obviously the one she was supposed to contact, it being unlikely that anyone else in this godforsaken place would know of the Pact.  How dare she react like this!  She spoke as though it was Laera’s whole idea!<br>
<br>
“I’m not going to say it again,” she muttered, struggling to maintain her civility.  “My name is Laera Nellynwae.  I was sent by Yeolarn Bronzeleaf as an emissary to meet with-“<br>
<br>
“Sent by whom?”  Dreketh’s arms folded, her brow furrowed in a show of agitation.<br>
<br>
Laera set her jaw squarely, standing with intentional dignity.<br>
<br>
“Yeolarn Bronzeleaf.  High priest of Tunare and spiritual leader of Her Elf followers.”<br>
<br>
“I have no idea who you’re talking about.  The Pact was set forth by a Teir’Dal priest named N’Threk.  He made all the arrangements, and if you don’t even know his name, then you’re no emissary.”<br>
<br>
Setting her jaw forward, Laera looked at Dreketh in perfect gall.<br>
<br>
“I’m not?” she asked, challenging the Dark Elf’s statement.  She placed her fists firmly against her hips.  “Okay, then who am I?”<br>
<br>
“You’re obviously some fool imposter who heard about the Pact somewhere and decided to get a piece of the action.”  Dreketh made a gesture at Laera’s appearance.  “Look at you.  I’ll wager you’ve never before left your little tree village over on Faydwer, have you?”<br>
<br>
“I most certainly-“<br>
<br>
“I don’t know how you came to find out about the Pact or my whereabouts, but it’s time to scuttle your way back home.”  Dreketh made shooing motions with her bronze hands.  “Go on, or you’ll get into trouble out here, girly.  Hurry before you try my patience.”<br>
<br>
Laera fumed.<br>
<br>
“I am an guardian of nature,” she spoke succinctly.  “By the grace and power of Tunare, I wield Her full authority as a druid.  I refuse to be spoken to in this manner by an abomination not of Her divine hand.“<br>
<br>
“Right, whatever,” Dreketh said offhandedly, reaching for Laera’s arm to lead her out of the cave.<br>
<br>
“Don’t touch me!” Laera jerked away from the Dark Elf’s hand, her voice echoing sharply above the constant murmur of the cavern.<br>
<br>
Having caught the attention of a particularly large and burly-looking barbarian Human, the two elves glanced up under his approaching shadow.  In a show of solid, rippling muscles the size of tree trunks, the enormous Human folded his arms and gazed down at the small upstarts before him.<br>
<br>
“Problem?” his baritone voice asked grimly.<br>
<br>
The two exchanged bitter glances, each trying to anticipate what the other might do.<br>
<br>
“No,” they both said simultaneously, each appearing sullen like two berated children caught fighting on a playground.<br>
<br>
“Good,” came the barbarian’s curt, heavily accented response.  “Both you leave and cool off.  Is uncomfortably hot in here, no?”<br>
<br>
Exchanging bitter glances again, the two silently left the sheltering cavern and traversed the tunnel until it opened out into the cooling night air of the East Commonlands.  Their only company was a small group of mixed travelers who had made camp right outside the entrance to the tunnel a short distance away.<br>
<br>
“Excellent,” Dreketh said piercingly over her shoulder as she marched away.  “Do you have any idea what you’ve just done?  I have to meet my contact inside that cave.  Now I can’t because of your outburst.”<br>
<br>
“I am your contact, Dark Elf,” Laera spoke tersely from behind.  “How many times do I have to tell this to you before your blue deaf ears hear me?  I am here to fulfill the Pact of Zeranon.”<br>
<br>
“Impossible!” Dreketh rounded on her companion, furiously.  “N’Threk would never accept a whelp from a weakling race to fulfill the Pact.”<br>
<br>
“Be very careful who you’re calling a whelp,” Laera’s voice lowered dangerously.  “Yeolarn Bronzeleaf himself chose me for this mission.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t care if Antonius Bayle’s court jester chose you for this mission.  You’re not my contact!”<br>
<br>
“Just what do-” Laera’s confused rage turned flustered as she hesitated.  “Antonius who?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh threw up her arms in frustration, turning her back on this simpleton.  Placing her hands on her hips, she shifted her weight to the other foot and stared at the rolling hills stretching out before her.  Why was she even trying to reason with this little annoyance?  She had to find a way back into the cavern, and quickly or the Pact may be broken before it even started.<br>
<br>
She decided it was time to prove her point.<br>
<br>
“Okay, fine,” Dreketh said over her shoulder.  “If you’re my contact, then tell me your instructions.  Precisely, or this conversation is finished.”<br>
<br>
Laera swallowed, unsure what to do or how much she was supposed to tell this Teir’Dal.  She was convinced, reluctantly, that this was her opposite number in the Pact.  Head Mistress Netheel said she was to meet with a Dark Elf female clad mostly in shining armor.  She had given Laera the exact location where to find her and that she would be the only one there who knew of the Pact or anything about it.<br>
<br>
“Well?” Dreketh spoke impatiently, her head turned to glare at Laera over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
Laera licked her lips, still uncertain.  Over and over the head mistress stressed the importance of serving the Pact over all other considerations.  She knew if she said nothing, the Pact was indeed threatened.  Somehow she had to convince this irrational embodiment of evil that she was who she claimed to be.<br>
<br>
Heaving a sigh, Laera swallowed.<br>
<br>
“I was told by Mis-… my superiors to travel across the Ocean of Tears.  Once I arrived on Antonica, I was to locate the Tunnel of Ro and seek the one who holds both keys of the dead.  Once found, I was to join you in the Pact and never leave your side.  I am to watch over you and keep you well and strong as you defend us both against those who may seek our demise.”<br>
<br>
Gaining resolve as she spoke, Laera stepped forward.<br>
<br>
“I am to be your guardian as you are mine, alone together in the world to meet and surmount all obstacles before us.  Only in this way will the Pact of Zeranon be fulfilled, and therefore the will of Tunare.  Those are the instructions I have been given, and nothing – not even you – will keep me from serving Her will.<br>
<br>
“So, if you don’t believe my claim,” Laera extended her arms wide, her hands empty, “then kill me now.  For it will be the only way you will be rid of me.  Go on.  Break the Pact, and be done with it.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s icy gaze blinked once, her grim expression frozen in place.  This dotard standing before her no longer seemed the whelp she did at first.  She spoke of the Pact with devout faith in her god.  As misled as that sentiment may have been, she was willing to die to fulfill it – a bluff no Elf imposter would make while standing before a Teir’Dal.  A Human, perhaps, but not an Elf.<br>
<br>
The one who holds both keys of the dead.  The words rang clearly in Dreketh’s mind.  No other Dark Elf fit that description besides her.  Incredulously, there was no longer any doubt.  This nature-loving druid named Laera Nellynwae was to be her companion in the Pact.<br>
<br>
She sneered caustically.  A Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
Turning about, Dreketh reached behind her shoulders and drew forth her father’s sword from its scabbard strapped to her back.  The ring of metal pervaded the night air and made Laera seize nervously, the sudden break in tension taking her off-guard.  Never once, however, did her eyes lose their fervency.<br>
<br>
Placing the blade of the magnificent sword in one gauntleted hand and the hilt in the other, Dreketh eyed her new companion darkly.  Thinking only of Master Quexill and his insistence of the importance of her mission, she brought the gleaming blade slowly to her lips.<br>
<br>
“Upon the hatred of the Prince and by the blade of my father, I vow to guard and protect you.  Your death in mine, my death in yours.  Together, we go forth.  So it was decreed, so it shall be done.”<br>
<br>
Sliding the sword abruptly back into its scabbard, Dreketh folded her arms to glower at Laera standing before her.  Her displeasure at the current situation shown plainly evident across her scowling face.<br>
<br>
Laera realized she had been holding her breath the entire time, having fully expected the dark one to impale her on that sword.  Releasing her breath carefully, she tried not to allow too much relief to show as she broke her gaze.  Her eyes closing, Laera silently whispered a prayer of thanks to Tunare.<br>
<br>
Reopening her eyes, her sight was met by Dreketh’s dire visage still standing motionless before her.  She supposed her first few self-introductions had been insufficient, and so ventured another try.<br>
<br>
“Laera Nellynwae, Druid of Tunare,” she said evenly, extending a customary hand in diffident greeting.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh’s eyes lowered to the Wood Elf’s proffered hand.  Pausing for a moment in consideration, Dreketh eventually reached out to grasp it in her own firm grip, the pinching folds of her bronze gauntlet making Laera wince.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh,” she said in a monotone voice.  “Shadow knight of Innoruuk and practitioner of the dead.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The awkwardness of the situation preyed on Laera.  Her new companion had spoken barely a word since leaving the tunnel entrance. <br>
<br>
Seeing as how neither of them were in any hurry to return to the cave merely for the privilege of paying to sleep on a floor mat, it was decided that they would make their way back to Freeport instead.  Dreketh mentioned in her laconic way that the guards held no love for Elves – Dark or otherwise – but they did occasionally allow outsiders to sleep in any spare bunks they may have available in the militia house.  The whole sentiment seemed dubious to Laera, but Dreketh explained their reasoning was founded in the fact that it was better than allowing miscreant foreigners to roam the streets, stirring up trouble.  At least in the militia house it was easy to keep a close eye on them.<br>
<br>
Shrugging, Laera gave way to her companion’s better judgement.  Dreketh had, after all, been born and raised in this part of the world, and she had only just arrived on this continent a few hours ago.  Besides, any promise of a bed made Laera’s spirits rise to no limits.  After her ship docked at dusk, she immediately embarked upon her journey to find the elusive Tunnel of Ro.  Having begged its whereabouts from the bothered citizens of Freeport, she traveled all evening and well into the night searching for the elusive thing.  She was exhausted, and couldn’t wait to see the inside of her eyelids for more than a few seconds at a time.  Judging from what little she knew about Teir’Dal habits, she figured it was probably time for Dreketh to be nodding off as well, with the impending sunrise.  <br>
<br>
At this point, that was plenty fine with her.  The sociability of her new travelling companion left a lot to be desired.  Candidly, Laera didn’t mind if Dreketh slept through the entire Pact.<br>
<br>
“Orcs,” came Dreketh’s monotone voice, as if summoned by the Wood Elf’s thoughts.<br>
<br>
“Hmm?”  Laera’s brow furrowed at the odd statement.<br>
<br>
“Crushbone orcs,” Dreketh continued, her lips pressed together.  “I refuse to slay any.”<br>
<br>
“Why not?”  Not that it mattered to Laera what Dreketh allowed to live, but she couldn’t fathom why the orcs of Crushbone neighboring her own homeland deserved such a grand concession.<br>
<br>
“I just won’t,” Dreketh snapped.  “So you can just forget about going anywhere near that place.”<br>
<br>
Laera shrugged her shoulders tolerantly.<br>
<br>
“Fine by me,” she said.  “As long as you respect my wishes and leave the natural fauna alone wherever we do go.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked up sharply.  She opened her mouth to protest until she remembered Laera’s occupation.  By design, a druid wouldn’t dream of upsetting nature’s supposedly delicate balance by hunting its native beasts.  The Dark Elf had even heard of places to the west where such sentiments were held so strongly, anyone caught fighting off a bear or wolf attack was executed outright on the spot.  Imagine!  Such short-sighted beliefs were beyond Dreketh.  As such, she could only suppose the leather they wore for protection grew on trees.  And besides, the beasts were living things – they’ll reproduce again like any other creature.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, she was stuck with someone who held strongly to those beliefs, and she knew there would be no peace until the boundaries of their relationship were agreed upon.  So be it, then.  In the interests of serving her own provisions in this Pact, she nodded her assent.<br>
<br>
As they journeyed eastward, the grass below their feet gave way to fine sands heralding their impending arrival at Freeport.  Laera sighed inwardly, not particularly eager to return to the musty, high-walled stronghold.  As a Wood Elf, she possessed a congenital love of nature.  To her it seemed more customary to embrace the world’s innate qualities, rather than wall yourself away from them.  In the end, what have you got?  A crowded, smelly prison full of people crawling all over each other to get from place to place.  What kind of way was that to live?<br>
<br>
At least Freeport offered a dazzling view of the open sky – something Laera positively adored.  Having grown up in the misty woods of Greater Faydark, she rarely saw the sun or the moon, or even the wispy clouds high above.  Seeing now the fiery glow of the sun’s ascent over the horizon made her heart melt.  She was bombarded by breathtaking rays of yellow, orange and peach that reminded her strongly of the mornings she had experienced in Felwithe during her annual visits there.<br>
<br>
Dreketh was less impressed with the spectacle toward which she walked.  To her, the rising sun meant the glare of blinding light in her eyes.  Dark Elves were, by and large, a nocturnal, subterranean race.  They dwelt in darkness in much the same way fish dwelt in water.  So much so, their entire city was built inside vaulting caverns – almost completely dark to all eyes but theirs.  The keen eyesight of the Teir’Dal granted them a marked advantage during nighttime endeavors, even to the point of seeing quite clearly in total blackness.  A very useful attribute, to be sure, but it became a source of much anxiety once the sun rose.  Though not exactly blinded by bright light, it wasn’t exactly comfortable either.<br>
<br>
The other Elven races weren’t without their share of night vision as well – though certainly not to the extent of their dark cousins.  Once the ambient light fell past a certain point, the eyes of the Elven kind were able to discern the soft, red glow of heat given off by living creatures.   While the night appeared considerably darker through their eyes as opposed to the eyes of the Teir’Dal, they were still able to find their way at night without suffering from any discomfort at other times – even in broad daylight.<br>
<br>
Laera figured that was part of the reason the Humans of  Freeport resented Elves so much, which reminded her of something else she wanted to bring up before they reached the gate.<br>
<br>
“What happens when we get there?” she asked.  “Won’t people think it strange we’re together?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh continued her rapid stride, uninterrupted.  Judging by the complete void of feedback, Laera couldn’t tell if Dreketh was ignoring her or didn’t hear the question.<br>
<br>
In reality, Dreketh was considering their options.<br>
<br>
“Let them,” she said sourly, her cynicism taking over.  “It’s not their business.”<br>
<br>
“But what do we say if someone asks about it?”<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry, I have it covered.”<br>
<br>
Laera supposed that was that.  She wondered drearily if such ascetic conversations were going to be the mainstay of their relationship.  They had been so far.<br>
<br>
As the unlikely pair approached the west gate of Freeport, they came across the sundry vermin that so frequented the grounds just outside.  Both looked in distaste at the massed indications of the town’s unclean squalor.<br>
<br>
Dreketh shook her head and gasped at the back of her throat in contempt.  For the first time in their relationship, she actually made an unprovoked comment.<br>
<br>
“I hate this barbaric place,” she spat.  “You’ll not see such refuse strewn before the gates of Neriak.”<br>
<br>
For once, Laera had to agree with her cohort.  Casting about the sandy ground, she saw every sort of creature she could imagine that crept or slithered.  Greater Faydark wasn’t exactly the most lifeless place in the world when it came to such things, but at least its inhabitants had the decency to clean up after themselves while hunting.  The area outside Freeport, however, was bedlam.  The sight that greeted her departure earlier that evening nearly gagged her when she had first seen it.  The place smelled of a heady musk that was overwhelming.  She knew that once she entered the city, she would eventually get used to it, but for the moment it was borderline intolerable.<br>
<br>
Resisting the temptation to hold her nose, Laera followed Dreketh up to the gate where two burly guards dressed in militia uniforms framed the entryway.  Casting a glowering look toward Dreketh, one of the guards broke away from his post and approached the two newcomers.<br>
<br>
“I’ll handle this,” Dreketh whispered.<br>
<br>
Drawing his sword, the guard blocked their path with the blade.  Dreketh’s smooth stride came to a glib halt inches away from its sharp edge.  She kept her gaze straight ahead arrogantly, as if even looking at the Human guard were somehow beneath her.<br>
<br>
“Ye a soldier?” came the guard’s inquiry.<br>
<br>
“No,” Dreketh replied, her abruptness exuding a clear defiance.<br>
<br>
“What are ye, then, dressed like that?  A mercen’ry?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh turned her head slowly, bringing her eyes to bear on the uneducated Human.  She raised a single hand and placed it artfully to rest on her hip, a crooked smirk gracing her lips.<br>
<br>
“I’m for hire, if that’s what you mean,” she said with a nefarious undertone. <br>
<br>
The guard took a moment to evaluate this Teir’Dal standing before him.  The tensions between their two nations were on a hiatus for the time being, but that didn’t mean Dark Elves were allowed to come and go as they pleased – especially known soldiers of the Dark Elf army.  As far as the local constabulary was concerned, Dark Elves in the city walls meant nothing but more work for them.  More often than not, they came to cause trouble, and those who didn’t often found it anyway if they wandered into the wrong parts of town.  <br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the occasional Dark Elf merchant or mercenary was tolerated as long as they seemed streetwise enough.  It was good for the local economy.  Dreketh’s calm demeanor and open approach would suggest she had nothing to hide.  <br>
<br>
What concerned the guard most was the armor she wore.  It was obviously of fine make, and marked her either as a prominent soldier in the Teir’Dal army or a highly skilled sword-for-hire.  Such talent of the latter was often sought by the wealthy in the port city, and denying such a person entry wouldn’t help the militia’s already less-than-perfect reputation among the populace.<br>
<br>
“Who’s she, then?”  The guard’s gaze slid to Laera.<br>
<br>
Dreketh cast a fluid eye over her shoulder toward the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
“Tech’len,” she said, wasting no more time for deliberation than she had to.<br>
<br>
The guard gave Laera an inspecting sweep with his eyes from head to foot and back again.<br>
<br>
“Kchal ver nieht?”<br>
<br>
“Niess.”<br>
<br>
Nodding to himself and giving Laera one more perfunctory glance, the guard chewed at whatever resided within his stubbled cheek and spat offhandedly to the ground.  Lowering his sword, he merely tilted his head toward the entryway, granting the two women permission to enter.<br>
<br>
“Watch yer step.  Both o’ ye.”<br>
<br>
Stepping forward as if the exchange never happened, Dreketh marched below the stone arches into Freeport.<br>
<br>
“What was that?” Laera asked, hurriedly trying to keep up with the shadow knight’s pace.<br>
<br>
“Which part?” came Dreketh’s monotone response.<br>
<br>
“Those words.  I didn’t understand them.”<br>
<br>
“Dark speech.”<br>
<br>
“Dark speech!  The Freeport guard knows Dark Speech?”<br>
<br>
“You’d be surprised.”<br>
<br>
That much was obvious to Laera.<br>
<br>
“Well, what did you say to him?” she pressed her questioning.<br>
<br>
“I told him you were my slave,” Dreketh said evenly.<br>
<br>
“You what!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh turned around, holding up a placating hand.<br>
<br>
“Shh, relax.”  She glanced furtively at a pair of passing guards who were taking note of the minor disturbance.  “He was about to turn us away, I could see it in his eyes.  I had to come up with something that would bring me up a few notches in his estimation.  Only the Teir’Dal aristocracy own slaves.  It was the only thing I could think of at the moment.”<br>
<br>
“So, what’s next?” Laera asked, frantically livid.  “You put me in a collar and lead me around on a chain like some kind of pet?”<br>
<br>
At seeing Laera’s agitated disposition, the two guards who were about to pass them by stopped a distance away and folded their arms to see if the dispute was going to evolve into something bigger.<br>
<br>
“Will you calm down?” Dreketh whispered in a growl, taking Laera by the arm and walking quickly down the path, away from their audience.  “You’re going to get us kicked out of town, or worse.”<br>
<br>
Rounding the corner, they stopped before a red brick building with an engraved brass placard hanging next to a nondescript door.  <br>
<br>
“First of all, the Teir’Dal break their slaves into total submission, so no such bonds are necessary to keep them in line.”  Dreketh’s hurried words made Laera’s skin crawl.  “Second, such open displays of slavery are forbidden in Freeport.  It’s illegal for citizens to own any, and outsiders are expected to maintain a don’t-ask-don’t-tell policy while in the city walls.”<br>
<br>
Her arms folded, Laera frowned angrily at her companion.<br>
<br>
“And what was with the look?” she asked.<br>
<br>
Dreketh opened her mouth silently with a raised eyebrow, carefully considering her words before she spoke.  “He was… asking how much you were.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s disposition returned from calmly irate back to livid.<br>
<br>
“He wanted to buy me?” she asked, incredulously.  <br>
<br>
“No, not at all,” Dreketh turned her back and opened the door with a jerk of her hand.  ”He just wanted to ‘rent’ you for an hour or two.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s jaw dropped clear to her chest, her voice eluding her in her outrage.  Giving it up for a lost cause, she stalked into the brick building after her companion.  By the gods, this wasn’t over yet.<br>
<br>
Marching up behind her “slaver,” Laera’s heated words caught in her throat as she came upon Dreketh addressing another guard sitting behind a table just inside the door.  Hunched over a stack of papers in front of him, the burly Human didn’t seem to be much in the mood for casual conversation.<br>
<br>
“Captain here?” Dreketh said calmly, looking straight ahead.<br>
<br>
“Out,” came the guard’s muted response, his eyes remaining glued to the scroll he was reading.<br>
<br>
“Mind if we crash?”  <br>
<br>
The guard shrugged, nonchalant, with a soft metallic jingle of armor.<br>
<br>
“First door down the right.  One day.  No board.”<br>
<br>
Nodding her silent thanks, Dreketh turned down the indicated hall.  She smiled to herself in satisfaction at actually obtaining a private room.  She made a mental note to wear her bronze armor often in the future.<br>
<br>
Arriving at the correct door, she reached out and turned the lockless handle.  Letting the door swing inward on nearly silent hinges, Dreketh’s thin-lipped smile made an encore appearance.  She noted, with gratification, the small twin beds sitting against the back wall of the room, facing each other from the corners.  Aside from three small sconces, the cinderblock room was otherwise empty save for a couple of crates stacked haplessly in the corner near the door.  <br>
<br>
Sounding suspiciously like a purring cat, Dreketh made a noise of contentment as she stepped into the room.  <br>
<br>
Laera poked her head in and made her own evaluation of their quarters.<br>
<br>
“This is it?” she asked with distaste.<br>
<br>
“What is it now?”  Dreketh was perturbed.  Deciding that whatever whining the Wood Elf was going to make could be heard just as well from bed, Dreketh selected the one on the left.  Walking over, she sat down, testing the thin mattress.<br>
<br>
“Well-“ Laera gestured with an open hand around the stark room.  “It’s empty.  Two beds and some crates with nothing but a few barely burning flames to see by?”<br>
<br>
Reaching down, Dreketh crossed one leg atop the other and began the task of pulling the brass greaves from her aching feet.  Now that she was sitting, she realized how tired she was.<br>
<br>
“This isn’t a hotel,” she said in a haggard tone.  “I take it you’re used to better in your little tree village?”<br>
<br>
Folding her arms, Laera made another distasteful glance around the room.<br>
<br>
“At least we have furniture.  And look, there are no windows.  I can’t see outside.  It makes me-”<br>
<br>
Releasing her foot, Dreketh let it fall suddenly with a striking boom as the metal boot hit the wooden floor.<br>
<br>
“Look,” she said, her voice low.  “It’s either this or one of the bunks the soldiers normally use in the common room, all right?  Personally, I’ve had my fill of Human eyes ogling over me as I get ready for bed.”  She jutted her chin at the open doorway as a passing guard stopped to glance inside.<br>
<br>
Turning, Laera smiled nervously at the guard and quickly closed the door.<br>
<br>
“If you ask me,” Dreketh continued, as she raised her foot to pull at it once again, “this place is luxurious compared to what I normally have to put up with in Freeport.  It’s free, and the bigoted jackasses in this town won’t rent me a room no matter how charming I am.  So do me a favor and shut up and go to sleep.  Your pain will be over in a few hours, I assure you.”  Her sarcasm was biting, as the greave finally gave way and slid off.  Quickly removing the sock underneath, Dreketh massaged her aching foot.<br>
<br>
Laera swallowed silently.  She felt like a child being scolded by her mother.<br>
<br>
“Fine,” she said haughtily, trying to regain some dignity as she marched to the other bed.  “It looks like I traded one head mistress for another.  It’s perfect.  Just perfect.”  Dropping her pack to the floor nearby, she flounced down onto the mattress, stewing as she glared up at the ceiling.<br>
<br>
Casting the Wood Elf a brief scowl, Dreketh shook her head to herself.  How did this undisciplined child ever become an advocate in the Pact?  Though Dreketh couldn’t have been her elder by more than a year or two, she couldn’t help imagine what this whining child would have done in the shadow knight’s guild on the first day of training.  The mental vision nearly made her laugh out loud.<br>
<br>
Shaking her head to clear it, Dreketh touched her foot to the floor and stood to finally unfasten the bronze leggings that so chafed her legs.  <br>
<br>
Laera fumed as she lay in bed across the way, her hands resting on her robed stomach.  Dreketh’s sudden rise from the other bed caught the druid’s attention, distracting her from her dismal thoughts.  She watched idly as the Dark Elf went about removing the polished bronze leggings, noting the blue skin of her legs underneath as they emerged.  <br>
<br>
For some reason the sight caught Laera off guard.  Her curiosity was piqued as she saw that the blue color of Dreketh’s skin wasn’t just her face and hands, but her entire body.  Well, of course it was!  What did she expect?  Still the night blue tint of the Dark Elf’s skin mystified the Wood Elf.  In plays performed at the bard’s guild back home in Kelethin, Elven actors playing Teir’Dal roles often used a powdery blue makeup on their face and hands to create the same effect.  The substance was created from the pollen of a rare flower found in Lesser Faydark that completely washed away with a brisk rinsing of water.<br>
<br>
It hit Laera that this blue skin before her was that of an actual, genuine Teir’Dal, and wouldn’t wash away when she bathed.  Events of the day happened so fast for the young and travel-weary druid, she hadn’t taken the time to realize that she was really alone with a true-blooded Dark Elf.  She had never been this close to one in her life!  The shocking realization of who and what she was with hit fully as she watched her companion with abstracted eyes.<br>
<br>
“What.”  Dreketh’s sharp voice broke the Wood Elf of her thoughts.<br>
<br>
Mildly startled, Laera blinked up to see the Dark Elf’s wary face staring back down at her.  Taking on a wanton look of indifference, Laera turned her head aside to stare at the wall neighboring her bed.<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” she said.<br>
<br>
Raising a cautious eyebrow, Dreketh began to passively wonder if the bunks outside weren’t a wiser choice after all.  Tentatively, she unstrapped the last of her armor from her shoulders and set it on the floor next to the other pieces.  Reaching up to her shoulders with both hands, she adjusted the straps of her undershirt with a quick snap, and slid beneath her single blanket resting atop the bare mattress.<br>
<br>
She had to admit, it was rather squalid compared to her berth in the Lodge of the Dead.  A part of her couldn’t help agreeing with Laera that the amenities Freeport offered its unwanted visitors were austere, but she would be damned before she let it show in front of her new companion.<br>
<br>
Curling up with her standard-issue Freeport militia pillow, Dreketh closed her eyes, coldly leaving Tunare’s Wood Elf advocate to whatever faculties she used to fall sleep in strange and unfamiliar places.<br>

<br>
Laera opened her eyes, blearily trying to bring the room into focus.  In her semiconscious state, she expected to see the familiar wood paneling of the dorm house in Kelethin.  Squinting in the relative darkness, she realized that the small sconce on the wall nearby couldn’t possibly be the one in her home.<br>
<br>
Then it all came back in a flash, and she suppressed the weary groan that threatened to escape her throat.  She silently asked herself why it couldn’t all have been a dream.  As her mind came closer to waking, the shadows of her mind vanished until she couldn’t recall what she’d been dreaming.<br>
<br>
Laera rubbed her eyes and tried to clear the cobwebs from her head.  Reaching her arms up, she folded them back so her hands met the back of her neck, her elbows hugging the side of her head.  She arched her back and stretched, letting out a jaw-cracking yawn.<br>
<br>
She felt as though she had been asleep for days.  A part of her wished that were possible, but the listless ache in her head told her she had likely been sleeping for a few scant hours.  Though exhausted when she first lay down on her comfortless bed at the militia house, recent events ran so many circles around her mind that she hadn’t been able to get to sleep right away.<br>
<br>
Sleeping in her druid robes didn’t help matters, either.  She’d had neither the motivation nor the energy to take them off, and so obstinately tried to make the best of things as she lay there waiting for slumber to overtake her.  Now she sorely regretted that lapse in judgement, feeling stifled and clammy in the folds of the heavy fabric.  Oh well, she didn’t find the thought of a bath unappealing in the least.<br>
<br>
Letting one hand slide out from behind her neck, she rested it on her chest, groggily wondering what time it was.  <br>
<br>
She glanced down near her feet to see if her brooding companion was awake yet.  To her surprise, she saw that the small cot was empty except for its disheveled pillow and blanket.  Furrowing her brow, she glanced around the room to find Dreketh sitting cross-legged on the floor, her back to the soft glow of the sconce on the Dark Elf’s side of the room.<br>
<br>
Laera sat up, the rustling of her robes the only sound in the dark, quiet room.  Squinting, she could barely make out Dreketh’s features.  The only light to touch the shadow knight fell in muted, flickering shades about her white hair and blue shoulders, leaving her face shadowed.  Her eyes were closed and her face had undertaken an oddly serene look – quite a contrast to the acerbic expression she usually wore.  The overall effect was statuesque, giving Laera the unnerving impression that the Dark Elf wasn’t even breathing.<br>
<br>
“Hello?”  Laera’s timid voice broke the silence.<br>
<br>
Dreketh drew in a long breath through her nose, her eyes flickering open.  Looking up to meet Laera’s dubious gaze, Dreketh raised her eyebrows and blinked once more before speaking.<br>
<br>
“Sorry,” she said, releasing her breath.  “I was meditating.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, I thought you might be,” Laera nodded, looking down at the floor.  “I didn’t know your kind did that, too.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh grunted softly as she swiped at her eyes once with a finger.<br>
<br>
“Most shadow knights don’t need to, this early in their training,” she said.  “I learned the technique when I was a necromancer.”<br>
<br>
Laera pursed her lips together, not particularly enjoying being reminded of her companion’s baneful nature.  Not especially interested in what strictures a Dark Elf chose to adhere to, Laera decided to change the subject.<br>
<br>
“Do you know what time it is?”<br>
<br>
“I’m not sure.”  Dreketh sighed, glancing briefly at the door.  “Though, I get the feeling the moon rose a few hours ago.”<br>
<br>
“Really?” Laera tilted her head curiously.  “You can sense the coming of the night?”<br>
<br>
“No,” Dreketh said, closing her eyes.  “It’s just a guess.”<br>
<br>
“Oh…”  Laera was surprised to discover a pang of disappointment.  Somehow she had assumed a creature of the night would harbor some sort of innate sense about it.  She imagined travelling with Dreketh was going to educate her about the Teir’Dal far more than she ever wished.  <br>
<br>
Which brought her to her next question.<br>
<br>
“Well, what do we do now?” she asked conversationally.<br>
<br>
Dreketh glanced askance at her companion.  She had privately been hoping Laera would know.  Her attempts at prying any information out of Kella N’Threk regarding what she was supposed to do once she met her counterpart had been less than fruitful.  Every time she broached the subject, the old priest began mucking evasively about some trifling matter or other, annoying Dreketh to no end.  Ultimately, she ended up leaving Neriak feeling unprepared for what awaited her, holding out a small hope that her future companion would be able to reveal more about their task.<br>
<br>
“You… don’t know?” Dreketh asked, loathe to reveal her insecurities.<br>
<br>
Laera’s face turned cautious.  She couldn’t tell if Dreketh’s question was one of ignorance on her part or a comment of scorn that Laera should even be there without knowing what she was supposed to do.<br>
<br>
“Well, I-“ she swallowed.  “I was told that Tunare would guide me to the correct path, but so far I haven’t received any signs.  So, I-“<br>
<br>
Dreketh collapsed her head in her hands, elbows resting on her cross-legged knees.  That should teach the Wood Elves to devote themselves to some weak-willed god.  She kept her thoughts silent, however, as Innoruuk wasn’t exactly stepping forward to enlighten the matter any, either.<br>
<br>
“What’s wrong?” Laera asked.<br>
<br>
Dreketh tilted her head to rest in one hand, rubbing her temple as she considered their options.  It was obvious that the Wood Elf was kept as much in the dark about the Pact as she had been.  <br>
<br>
“I think…” she began, hesitantly.  “We should to find out more about this Pact.  Unfortunately, the one man in Neriak who knows anything about it is… well… less than forthcoming.”<br>
<br>
“Neither was my head mistress,” Laera admitted, staring distractedly at the flame near her own bed.  “She kept talking about faith and how Tunare’s chosen should be filled with Her light and not ask such trivial things.  She made it seem to make sense at the time, but now that I’m saying it out loud, I-”<br>
<br>
Dreketh rolled her eyes, letting out an aggravated sigh through her teeth.<br>
<br>
Laera pressed her lips together, not thrilled at the idea of being the object of the Dark Elf’s mockery.<br>
<br>
“Listen you weren’t there, okay?” she said, a hint of irritation entering her voice.  “So break with the attitude.”<br>
<br>
“At least I have a reason for my ignorance beyond being blinded by my own heedless devotion.”  Dreketh placed a finger on the center of her own chest.  “My patron is a crazy old priest people take only half-seriously in the first place.  I counted myself lucky to even pick up the name ‘Zeranon’ in his muddled ramblings.”<br>
<br>
Laera folded her arms, her face burning partially at the shadow knight’s caustic insult, but mostly at the indignity of looking naïve in front of her partner.  She wasn’t about to apologize for her faith, no matter how foolish the Dark Elf made it sound with her twisted words.<br>
<br>
Amidst her fuming, a thought occurred.<br>
<br>
“What is Zeranon, anyway?” she asked, her brow creased.  “Is it a person or place or what?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh cast a glance at the druid, her thoughts interrupted by the Wood Elf’s irksome voice.  She was about to make another biting remark when the question sank in, and she realized she had no good answer.  She had always assumed Zeranon was a person.  The idea that it could be a place or some other expression never crossed her mind.  <br>
<br>
“It’s…” she pondered aloud.  Coming up empty, she cast Laera a blank look.  “I have no idea.”<br>
<br>
Laera realized she had obtained some amount of vindication in her companion’s eyes for asking the right question.  Her expression softened as she saw Dreketh’s unknowing expression.  In the back of her mind, she wondered why the opinion of this Dark Elf suddenly mattered at all to her.<br>
<br>
“Well,” she said, returning to the problem at hand.  “I suppose that’s as good a place to start as any.”<br>
<br>
“I think so,” Dreketh replied, her gaze wandering sightlessly about the room in her pondering.<br>
<br>
Laera swept her feet around over the side of her bed to rest on the floor.  Standing, she reached her fists above her head, stretching her back once more.  She habitually began her morning routine of limbering up her taut muscles.<br>
<br>
“The question now is,” she said, bending sideways, one hand reaching over her head, “where do we go to find out?  We’re not supposed to leave each other’s side, so if we went anywhere near Greater Faydark to ask my head mistress, you’d be attacked on sight by the first Elf who saw you.”<br>
<br>
“The same would happen to you if we went to Neriak.” <br>
<br>
Laera raised her other hand to stretch the other direction.<br>
<br>
“Not that I’m all that eager, mind you, but what about the slave hoax we used to get into Freeport?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh immediately shook her head.<br>
<br>
“That would never work.  If someone who knew me saw us together, they’d know someone of my standing would never be able to own a slave, much less a Wood Elf female.  Besides, my instincts tell me the priest would be useless, and to my knowledge the Pact of Zeranon is never mentioned in any books of the library.” <br>
<br>
Feeling much more awake, Laera let her arms drop to her sides.  She found herself looking forward to that bath now that the clouds of sleep were banished.  She felt a few small pangs of hunger, as well.<br>
<br>
“So, what do we do?” she asked, placing her hands on her hips in a brisk manner, trying to appear optimistic.<br>
<br>
Dreketh took another moment to finish her thoughts before making her suggestion.<br>
<br>
“Well, there’s one place I’m certain would have what we need.  The library of Erudin holds just about every legendary myth and prophecy ever dreamt of, but that’s a long journey from here.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s eyes narrowed, mulling over Dreketh’s proposition.<br>
<br>
“They’d let you into Erudin?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“No, probably not,” Dreketh clasped her hands together, her index fingers forming a steeple she placed against her lips.  “But I know of someone who could get inside for us.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked at her companion dubiously, not able to envision what sort of acquaintance a Dark Elf could have that far west on a lonely island in the middle of the ocean.<br>
<br>
Glancing up and seeing the druid’s doubtful expression, Dreketh uncrossed her legs to stand.<br>
<br>
“If it’s to be found at all, that library has it,” she said conclusively.  “Its archives are legendary as the most complete repository in all of Norrath.”<br>
<br>
“What if you’re wrong?” Laera looked at the Dark Elf balefully.  “Suppose the Pact wasn’t meant for any mortal knowledge, and no record of this ‘Zeranon’ exists.”<br>
<br>
“I’d find that very hard to believe,” came Dreketh’s retort.  “Do you have anything better in mind?”<br>
<br>
“I just don’t want to go traipsing across Norrath on the off-chance that some obscure record might exist on an island located in the backwater reaches of Norrath.  Even if it did, there’s still the slimmest of chances we’d be given access to it.”<br>
<br>
“What happened to the famous wanderlust of the Wood Elves?  I thought there was no land you left unexplored?”<br>
<br>
“That doesn’t mean we go poking our heads under a falling axe just because the rings on the tree stump haven’t been counted.  The lands between here and there are treacherous, even I know that.  And let’s face it, neither one of us are exactly journeymen.  So, please forgive me if I feel more comfortable heading to places a little more our speed.”<br>
<br>
“Fine, then.”  Dreketh threw her hands up.  “Answer my question.  Where do you think we should go?”<br>
<br>
“I think we should try talking to my head mistress,” Laera shrugged a shoulder.  “Or even better, that priest of yours.  He obviously knows more than he’s letting on.  Maybe he’d say more if we confronted him together.  Best of all, he’s right here in east Antonica.”<br>
<br>
“He’s in Neriak, daft one.  You wouldn’t last two seconds after setting foot in Nektulos Forest before a patrol found us and slit your tan little throat, and probably mine right along with it for consorting with your kind.”<br>
<br>
“Not if you tell them I’m your slave,” Laera spoke succinctly.<br>
<br>
“We’ve been through this already.  If anyone recognized me we’d be finished.  I’ll say it again – only aristocracy own personal slaves, and slaves from Faydwer are extremely rare.  What handful of Wood Elf slaves that exist in Neriak are so highly valued that only nobility can afford them.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s skin crawled at hearing Dreketh talk so glibly about members of her race is if they were so much chattel.  Doing her best to ignore the shiver running up her spine, she cast about trying to think of a compromise that might work.  <br>
<br>
“That leaves us with Greater Faydark,” she said with a shrug.<br>
<br>
“Seeing as how you Wood Elves don’t believe in the ‘immorality of slavery,’ ” Dreketh’s sarcasm was biting, “I don’t see how you’ll explain my presence to those guarding your tree village.”<br>
<br>
“You wouldn’t have to go up in the trees.  There are at least a hundred places I know of where we can hide out.”<br>
<br>
“And how are we supposed to have our little talk with your teacher if we’re hiding out?”<br>
<br>
“I’ll find someone to run into the city and bring her to us.”  Laera held up her hand, halting Dreketh’s sneering response.  “Relax, I can camouflage you so nobody I talk to will see you.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh held up her index finger.<br>
<br>
“All it would take is for one single Elf to see me, and it would be all over,” she said, her voice grave.  “Forget it, it’s too risky.  Approaching Neriak would seem simple by comparison.”<br>
<br>
“Why do you think I suggested it in the first place!”  Laera’s tone indicated she had reached the end of her patience.  “Neriak is the only solution we have left.”<br>
<br>
She couldn’t believe she was actually arguing in favor of marching right into Neriak, of all places.  Neriak – the heart of the despised Teir’Dal, and wellspring of evil to all respectable lands of Norrath.  Still, it was better than finding herself impaled on the end of some creature’s blade on their way through central Antonica.  Rumors spread wild in Kelethin about the dangers that abounded there.  Memories of gruesome stories told late at night flooded Laera’s mind, resurrecting images of the resulting nightmares she’d had as a child.<br>
<br>
Worst of all were the undead. Dreadful rumors were spoken across Faydwer about the recent hauntings of central Antonica by the undead.  Not the puny, decrepit skeletons like those meandering their dazed way around Greater Faydark, but true evil hosts of the underworld.  She had heard tales of hideous ghouls with glowing eyes and sepulchral  voices that echoed eerily from their throats as if coming from deep within a cavernous tomb.  Such creatures were said to be invulnerable to any normal weapon, wielding dark spells that captured your soul, making you one of them.<br>
<br>
No, far better to take her chances with the living – Teir’Dal or otherwise.  Whatever cruelty they could inflict on her, at least her immortal soul was safe with Tunare in the end.  <br>
<br>
A glint of metal in the firelight caught her eye from the floor next to Dreketh’s bed.  Stepping forward, Laera knelt on one knee, examining the finery of the armor lying before her.<br>
<br>
“I don’t suppose you have a helm to go with this?” she asked, thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
“No.”  The Dark Elf shook her head.  “No breastplate either.”<br>
<br>
Laera glanced up at her companion.<br>
<br>
“Do you think we can get one?”<br>
<br>
“We’re not going to Neriak.”<br>
<br>
Laera stood upright, her face grim.  “Why not?  Because it’s not your idea?’<br>
<br>
“Because it would be pointless!  What we’re looking for can’t be found in Neriak!”<br>
<br>
“Are you sure of that?  Are you absolutely sure the priest has nothing more?”<br>
<br>
“Nothing more than he’s already given me, and he has even less to give to a Wood Elf.”<br>
<br>
“How can you be so sure?  How do you know that my presence wouldn’t make a difference in what he might say?”<br>
<br>
“Oh, it would make a difference.  He’d say ‘get this worthless waste of skin out of my sanctum and onto a boat sailing for Odus!’ ”<br>
<br>
Laera folded her arms, angrily.  This was going nowhere.<br>
<br>
“Let me put it this way,” she said, the calm in her voice strained by underlying exasperation.  “If we went to Erudin and discovered nothing, what would we do next?”<br>
<br>
“If the Pact is mentioned anywhere in Norrath-“<br>
<br>
“Humor me.  Where would we go to find the answers, if we found no mention of it?  If you’re correct about the library at Erudin, then there could be absolutely no record of it anywhere else in the world.  Correct?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh clenched her teeth, already seeing where this was going.  Refusing to play along with the druid’s ramblings, she made no comment.<br>
<br>
“But,” Laera continued, “we each know where to find someone who knows at least something of Zeranon, don’t we?  And since Greater Faydark is such a high risk for you, that leaves only one place left to go.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh turned her head to glare at mid-air out the corner of her eye.<br>
<br>
“Wouldn’t it be terrible if we had to come all the way back to Neriak from Odus to find our answers, when they were right here in front of us the whole time?”  Having sensed her victory in the argument, Laera’s voice took on a mildly smug quality.  “I don’t know about you Dark Elves, but I don’t relish the idea of-”<br>
<br>
“You’ve made your point!” came Dreketh’s abrupt response.  Rankled, it was her turn to fold her arms as well.  “Since you insist on sticking your neck out, we’ll go to Neriak first.  Once you’re convinced there is nothing there to find, we travel to Erudin and attempt my plan.  Agreed?”<br>
<br>
The two Elves stood there scowling across the room, a mirror of each other both physically and spiritually.  Equally opposite in nearly every respect, it seemed fate had chosen the most unlikely pair to fulfill the Pact of the gods – the Pact of Zeranon.  In the dark, hushed room they stood, their mutual expressions reflected in the other’s eyes.<br>
<br>
“Agreed,” Laera said, breaking the silence.<br>
<br>
“Good,” the Dark Elf replied.  “There’s just one provision.”<br>
<br>
Laera didn’t move a muscle, continuing her dark stare as Dreketh’s features slowly transformed into an evil grin.<br>
<br>
“Your bindless status as my slave just took a turn for the worse,” she said wickedly.<br>
<br>
“What are you talking about?”  Laera shook her head, irritated.  She was in no mood for the Dark Elf’s self-satisfied display.<br>
<br>
“I’m saying you’re no longer a slave, but my captive.  No Wood Elf slave would be allowed to roam the countryside with some underling soldier, or anyone for that matter.  They’re too valuable.  Therefore, I captured you on Faydwer and am willing to sell you to the highest bidder on the auction block.  That’s the story, anyway.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s expression turned to outrage.<br>
<br>
“You…can’t…be serious,” Laera spoke in an angry undertone.<br>
<br>
“It’s the only way to get you past the guards,” Dreketh shrugged.  ”Getting you out again is the difficult part.  I’m hoping the temple will have an extra suit of armor for you to wear.  By the time word gets around that a real Wood Elf is soon to be brought to the auction block, we should be long gone.”<br>
<br>
“Not a chance, inkie.  I’m not going into Neriak bound in chains!”<br>
<br>
“And gagged.”<br>
<br>
“Forget it!”<br>
<br>
“Fine, get enough provisions to last you until we make it to Odus, then.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s resolve wavered.  What just happened?  How did this Teir’Dal turn her victory into such a sudden defeat?  It was obviously a sign of their inherent treachery.  She made a mental note to be more on her guard when talking to Dreketh from now on.<br>
<br>
Her nostrils flaring with every breath, the druid broke her gaze with her companion.<br>
<br>
But that was the future.  What of the moment?  Taking a leisurely jaunt into the heart of darkness was bad enough on its own.  As much as the idea made her cringe, it was something she saw as a necessary evil.  But to be paraded in chains among all those gloating blue-skinned faces, bound and humiliated before their malevolent eyes, made her heart stop.  A part of her almost considered taking the trip to Odus after all.<br>
<br>
Almost.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="file:///storyline/storyIL.txt">Table of Contents</a><br>
<br>
<c "#FFff00">Chapter 7 - Neriak</c><br>
<br>
Two pairs of eyes peered into the darkness of Nektulos Forest from the relative safety of the thicket.<br>
<br>
Laera couldn’t believe she was actually looking upon the fabled Nektulos – the place where no light dweller ventured.  At least, no ordinary light dweller.  It was rumored that a few members of other races besides the Teir’Dal lived there as well, though she couldn’t fathom under what circumstances they were accepted into Dark Elf society.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s first glimpse of the forest took her by mild surprise.  She imagined she might have mistaken it for Greater Faydark had she stumbled across it unknowingly.  Save for lacking the towering trees of her home that rose hundreds, sometimes thousands of feet into the air, Nektulos possessed some very familiar qualities.  The grassy forest floor, the mist-filled air, the ever-present sounds of the forest creatures all rang true to her.  <br>
<br>
However, she did, in fact, know it was Nektulos she was looking at, and the sense of power surrounding the place made her blood turn cold.  Somehow the forest seemed darker than the Faydark.  More sinister.  Evil.  She could see the occasional red-coated Dark Elf running amongst the trees, apparently searching for game to hunt.  It put her teeth on edge, knowing she was surrounded on all sides by Innoruuk’s legions.  And there she was, a simple Wood Elf druid alone among them.<br>
<br>
Well, she supposed she wasn’t entirely alone.  This Dark Elf crouching next to her, while not her first choice of trusted companions, was her only lifeline to the outside world.  Under any other circumstances, she wouldn’t trust Dreketh the give her the time of day in a Gnomish clock factory.  Yet there she was, depending on this Teir’Dal for her very life as she aimed to enter the Dark Elf city of Neriak.  <br>
<br>
Things could be worse, but not by much.  At least she’d had the chance to bathe before they left Freeport that morning.  <br>
<br>
Having stashed away her druid robes, she now wore the odd assortment of worn patchwork Dreketh had purchased for her.  Deciding the workmanship of Rigel’s tunic would be too fine for a captive slave, she decided it would be best to keep it hidden in the bottom of her pack for safekeeping.<br>
<br>
It nearly cost them every piece of platinum they had, but they also managed to procure a bronze helm that loosely matched Dreketh’s armor.  Lowering the visor obscured her features well enough to hide her identity, alleviating any fear of being recognized.   <br>
<br>
Glancing next to her, Laera noticed Dreketh’s calm demeanor as the Dark Elf craned her neck.  Holding her new helm in her hands, Dreketh peered intensely into the mists, glancing around as though searching for something.<br>
<br>
“What is it?” Laera asked in a whisper.<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” Dreketh responded, still glancing about.  “The guards patrol this route.  I’m just waiting for one to show up.  If we wandered out through the forest and came across anyone in the slave market, there would be very little stopping them from simply taking you from me and selling you themselves.  At least with a guard escort, we’ve got a clear run through the forest to Neriak.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s heart pounded feverishly at the prospect of actually being sold into slavery.  She had no idea what Neriak was like, but she knew spending the rest of her life under the Teir’Dal’s thumb would be an excruciating fate.<br>
<br>
No, she thought to herself.  Tunare would protect her.  She had a calling to perform.<br>
<br>
“Good, there’s a guard,” Dreketh spoke in a muted voice.  “Not a dragoon, but an officer, so he can be trusted.”  She turned to Laera.  “It’s time now.  Come on, we have to hurry.”<br>
<br>
Her heart sinking, the Wood Elf resignedly placed her wrists together in front of her.   The Dark Elf quickly began to bind her hands with a leather thong.<br>
<br>
The dispirited druid knew this time had been fast approaching, and met it with revulsion.  Since they first entered the canyon leading in from the Commonlands, Dreketh had been nagging her to submit to the restraints in case anyone caught sight of them.  Laera refused, saying if things went wrong at first she needed to be able to make a quick escape.  Though unpredictable if used for long periods of time at her level of training, the druid’s camouflage spell would easily allow her time to escape in a pinch.  After yet another ensuing debate in a long stream of arguments they had had that day, it was agreed that Laera would wait until the last moment before being fettered.<br>
<br>
Working with quick hands, Dreketh bound the Wood Elf’s wrists together tightly.  A small chain, further restrained her hands to a collar about her neck, placing her in a position of supplication, as if she were begging or praying.  Finally, Dreketh restricted Laera’s elbows to her sides with a hemp cord wrapped repeatedly around her torso.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf’s touch as she went about her task sent a loathing chill through Laera.  The careless, alien touch of those blue-skinned hands felt entirely unnatural as they yanked on her restraints, making them snug enough to satisfy any close inspection the guard may perform.<br>
<br>
“Okay, let’s get this over with,” Laera muttered, preparing to stand.  Looking up, she saw the guard was still a fair distance away from their hiding place, but fast approaching.<br>
<br>
“Not quite,” Dreketh said.<br>
<br>
Laera glanced over at the Dark Elf, her eyes widening at the sight of a small cloth handkerchief resting in her companion’s hand.<br>
<br>
“I said no!” she whispered piercingly.<br>
<br>
“And I said no slaver worth their weight in ogre brains would ever hold a captive who could bring down the wrath of the world on them by yelling for help.  Now do you want this the easy way, or the hard way?”<br>
<br>
Laera made a perfunctory pull at her bonds.  Finding them unrelenting, she silently cursed Dreketh’s skill at binding her – not to mention Dark Elf guile in general.<br>
<br>
“We agreed, inkie!” the Wood Elf growled angrily through clenched teeth.<br>
<br>
“I lied,” Dreketh shrugged, nonchalant.  Standing, she began to stuff the handkerchief in her companion’s mouth.<br>
<br>
“You lying troll wharfgarrfmmm-“  Laera’s livid words were lost in the quick-handed skill of the Dark Elf, as she began tying the gag securely. The helpless druid couldn’t stifle her yelp as the handkerchief was yanked into place, a few strands of her auburn hair having been caught in the knot.  <br>
<br>
Seeing the guard stop suddenly at hearing the muffled sound, Dreketh roughly picked up the Wood Elf and shoved her into the open road.  Laera stumbled, but managed to maintain her haphazard footing.  She glanced in defenseless panic at the approaching guard, like a crippled animal about to be slaughtered.<br>
<br>
Before the guard was able draw his sword, Dreketh went into action.<br>
<br>
“I said quiet!” she yelled from the bushes.  Stepping out onto the road herself, she approached her “slave” with a hand on her sword.  “I’ve had enough of your constant whining!  You’re fortunate I don’t-”<br>
<br>
Turning, Dreketh made as if she saw the guard standing there for the first time.<br>
<br>
“Lieutenant,” she said, turning respectfully from her “prisoner” to address the guard.  “Thank the gods you’re here.  I need an escort to the city entrance.”<br>
<br>
“By the Father’s hatred, what have we here?” the guard spoke from inside his helmet.  Stepping forward to stand before Laera, he reached out to take her jaw in his armored hand.  “As I live and breathe, a real Wood Elf female.”  Turning, he addressed Dreketh suspiciously.  “You caught her?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh closed her eyes and nodded her head, acknowledging the guard’s question with a self-satisfied smirk gracing her features.<br>
<br>
“It took some doing,” she said, tossing her white hair back conversationally.  “These puny things are deceptively cunning in their attempts to get away.”<br>
<br>
“Notoriously so,” the lieutenant agreed, distractedly returning his attention back to the Wood Elf.  “Is that how you lost your chestpiece?” <br>
<br>
Dreketh glanced down at her mismatched leather tunic amid the otherwise full suit of bronze plate.<br>
<br>
“She had… friends,” she said, trying not to sound as though floundering for words.  “It was a furious battle that ended in one of their deaths by the Touch.  I caught this one as she fled behind her cowardly comrades.  I saw the opportunity, so I seized it.”<br>
<br>
“Couldn’t have been too difficult,” the guard muttered, his eyes tracing Laera’s unblemished features closely.  “She seems no worse for wear.”<br>
<br>
“She’s a druid,” Dreketh responded quickly, a note of arrogance belying her tension.  “I had her heal the cuts and bruises of her futile struggle.  It wouldn’t do to have her on the auction block all battered up, now, would it?”<br>
<br>
The guard inspected Laera’s restraints.<br>
<br>
“She did that while bound, did she…?” he said, suspicion returning to his voice.<br>
<br>
“Relax, I had her under my full control the whole time,” Dreketh said, deliberately adding a touch of incense to her voice.  “At the time, I saw no reason to have her bleed all over me as I brought her in, but since you’re so keen…”<br>
<br>
Dreketh raised her bronze-booted foot and thrust it, sole first, into Laera’s midriff.  Doubling over, the Wood Elf’s face met Dreketh’s gauntlets as they pulled up, sending her sprawling backward.  Powerless to retain her balance under her partner’s unexpected assault, Laera fell with a muffled shriek to the road in a billowing cloud of dust.  <br>
<br>
The world spun around her head as the Wood Elf tried to recover her dazed senses, the warm, wet feel of blood meeting her lips.  An abrupt wave of nausea swept over her, and she lay to the ground, unwilling to move as she waited for her vision to clear.  <br>
<br>
Laera’s only coherent thought was that she had been betrayed.  Pact or no Pact, she was a fool to trust in a Teir’Dal.  What was she thinking?  The depth of her naiveté sank into her like a dagger.<br>
<br>
Somewhere out of the swirling maelstrom surrounding her, a hand brutally took hold of her hair at the top of her head, pulling her upright to lean against something cold and hard.<br>
<br>
“There, she’s a mess again.  Satisfied?” a female voice spoke.  Laera heard the words, but couldn’t reason out what they meant.<br>
<br>
“Fine, you made your point,” the guard’s careless voice wafted its way to the Wood Elf’s ears. <br>
<br>
“Now sit up, weakling.”<br>
<br>
Resting limply against Dreketh’s bronze armored thigh, the Wood Elf’s eyes rolled dazedly.  The pull on her hair increased painfully until she scrambled her legs to take her weight off of it.  At last, the world righted itself and she managed a tenuous hold on her balance, resting on both knees at Dreketh’s feet.  <br>
<br>
Finally getting a grip on her senses, she felt the trickle of blood running unchecked from her nose to her gagged mouth.  She tried to reach up to wipe it away with her hand, but was quickly reminded of her bound state by the restraining cord wrapped around her torso.  Unable to reach her face, she helplessly allowed the blood to mar her features.<br>
<br>
Watching the scene unfold before him, the guard stood silent, his expression hidden behind the faceplate of his helm.  Dreketh turned to the guard evenhandedly.<br>
<br>
“Now then,” she said, her lips curved in a crooked grin.  “As I said before, I’m requesting an escort to the city gates.  My prize is too valuable to risk on the dangers of the forest, not to mention the competition.”<br>
<br>
“So it would seem,” the lieutenant grunted in agreement.  Removing his helm, he eyed the reticent Wood Elf.  “I haven’t seen a Wood Elf slave brought in since that last one died during his conditioning several months ago.  A pity they’re so fragile…”<br>
<br>
Laera idly wondered who that poor Wood Elf might have been.  Her thoughts wandered painfully close to Rigel.  It could have just as easily been him or another friend of hers, and here were these callous Teir’Dal talking about his death as if he were livestock. <br>
<br>
“So, what are you saying?” Dreketh’s gruff tone intruded.<br>
<br>
“I’m saying this race is brittle,” the lieutenant continued in a glib voice.  “Few survive their conditioning, and those that do are highly valued.  You know it and I know it.  And to top it off, this one’s female.  Assuming she survives, you stand to easily make her weight in platinum.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh folded her arms, frowning darkly.  “What do you want?” she muttered.<br>
<br>
The guard made a show of consideration as he sized up the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
“I want half,” he said, finally.<br>
<br>
“Forget it,” came Dreketh’s immediate response.<br>
<br>
“Fine by me,” the lieutenant shrugged, turning to take his leave.  “I’d keep an eye out for those kodiaks in this area, if I were you.  They can be a real nuisance to a novice slave hunter who chooses to tempt fate even more than she already has.”<br>
<br>
Looking around with an angry look of disgust clouding her face, Dreketh’s mental reckonings were apparent.<br>
<br>
“If I wait here another ten minutes, I’ll find someone else who will help me out for a fraction of that,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Fair enough,” the guard said over his shoulder.  “Here’s hoping they don’t decide the whole pie is better than a slice of it.”<br>
<br>
“Wait!”  Dreketh’s eyes shot daggers at the lieutenant’s back.<br>
<br>
Her arms still folded, she sauntered her way to the halted guard.  Biting her lip she slowly rounded his shoulder to look him in the face.<br>
<br>
“A third,” she said, sighing.  “No more.”<br>
<br>
The guard glanced over his shoulder at the Wood Elf kneeling in the middle of the road behind him, her arms tightly bound.  Though blood now sullied her downcast face, he remembered clearly her pure, attractive features during his earlier examination.<br>
<br>
“A third and a week,” the guard grunted.<br>
<br>
“A third and a day, final offer,” Dreketh countered.<br>
<br>
“I’ll kill her now and then you can call it final.”<br>
<br>
“You do that and every dragoon in the Indigo Brotherhood will know about your little enterprise you’re running on the side.”<br>
<br>
The guard’s expression froze grimly in place, his eyes searching Dreketh for any hint of a bluff.  The shadow knight’s features remained stone cold, her aspect truly one to be expected of a denizen of the dead.<br>
<br>
Dreketh had seen guards barter before, and none displayed this much savvy in negotiating a price.  The only explanation was that this particular lieutenant was dealing in something on the side – a practice devoutly forbidden by the city guard.  In typical Teir’Dal fashion, conflicts of interest were dealt with quickly and severely, regardless of rank.  In an act of desperation, the shadow knight decided to go with her instincts and play this gamble.<br>
<br>
“All right, let’s make this quick,” the guard relented.  Raising a finger before Dreketh’s face, he spoke tersely.  “And I get my day before her conditioning, not after.  If she doesn’t survive, I’ll not bed a corpse.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh blinked slowly, coolly shifting her icy gaze to the Wood Elf over the lieutenant’s shoulder.  At hearing his words, Laera’s downcast face had upturned, her expression on the verge of panic.  Dreketh saw a pleading fear in the depths of her eyes, far transcending whatever fear she had shown previously at the mention of her conditioning.  <br>
<br>
A sneer crossed Dreketh’s lips.  Returning her gaze to the lieutenant, she nodded once in agreement to his terms.<br>
<br>
Without pause, the lieutenant turned and began stalking down the road back the way he came.<br>
<br>
“Get up, whelp” Dreketh barked, taking Laera by the shoulder to aid her in standing. “We’ll clean you up once we’re inside.”<br>
<br>
Disheartened, the Wood Elf meekly complied with her captor’s assistance. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Their trip through Nektulos remained uneventful.  Whatever dark, misshapen creature that crossed their way fell to the blade of the guard within moments of its appearance.  Several blue-skinned bystanders cast Laera forbidding looks as they watched the bound and beaten Wood Elf traipse her way under Dreketh’s firm, controlling hand.  Apparently the arrival of a new Elven slave was not a common sight.<br>
<br>
The confused druid took the time to try and reason through recent events.  A part of her was no longer certain this was a charade.  Dreketh’s unexpected assault, the rough handling, the ardent bargaining – so many things suggested that she was truly a captive of this Dark Elf shadow knight, about to be sold for a veritable fortune.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, that may have been the point all along.<br>
<br>
Still, if Dreketh were willing to go to such lengths to deliver a convincing performance, exactly how far did she expect Laera to go?  How much of their negotiations were real, and how much was pretense?  What was she supposed to do once they arrived in the city?  So many questions raced through Laera’s throbbing head, but she couldn’t voice them in front of the lieutenant as he led their way through the dismal forest.  <br>
<br>
Even without the guard, her gag made any protest futile.  The only thing she knew for certain was that she was frightened, and became increasingly so as they made their approach to the Dark Elf city.  <br>
<br>
All too soon, the grim entrance appeared before them as the trees gave way to a small clearing against stone cliffs.  In the distance stood a yawning pentagon-shaped cave in the mountainside, surrounded by gray stone rubble strewn about.  Illuminated in its grandeur above the cave was engraved the sinister emblem of the Teir’Dal, carved to gigantic proportions from the living rock of the mountainside.  <br>
<br>
The spectacle was breathtaking on many levels, but none more dauntingly so than for the Wood Elf being led there.<br>
<br>
Glancing down to the grounds before the entrance, Laera found it littered with dozens of the Teir’Dal horde.  Her breath catching in her throat, she met the sight with terror-filled eyes.  So many Dark Elves.  So many blue-skinned bodies in the same place, all at once cursing the rest of the world.  The evil and hatred before her made her want to turn and run as far as her feet would carry her until she reached the sanctity of her own woodland home or until a Teir’Dal arrow impaled her through the back.  Either way, she would not have to enter that abominable place.<br>
<br>
Wishes notwithstanding, her captors led her relentlessly toward the city entrance.  As the three of them advanced, more and more eyes turned their way expectantly.  Apparently, word was spreading rapidly among the throng that a new and rare slave was about to be delivered.  That another light dweller was about to be put under the mighty heel of the Teir’Dal, and that she approached even now.<br>
<br>
By the time they reached the outskirts of the crowd, all present eagerly awaited her arrival.  Voices rang out in a cacophony of taunts and cheers as the Dark Elves unanimously celebrated the sight of a torn and beaten enemy being paraded before them.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh quickly donned her bronze helm and drew her sword, preparing to defend her prize against the growing crowd.  The helm, too, provided her protection against any familiar eyes who would recognize and mark her as merely an overdressed trainee.<br>
<br>
The lieutenant, too, took up a confrontational stance as he took up the onerous task of clearing a path before them.<br>
<br>
As they made their approach, Laera felt something cold and wet strike her shoulder.  Turning, she caught a glimpse of a snake’s egg moments before it struck her in the forehead, its slimy innards seeping over her eyes.  Yet another unidentified object hit sharply against Laera’s back.  And another.  Soon, all sorts of items – both hard and fragile – came hurtling her way.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh cursed a peevish oath under her breath.  Taking a firm hold across the Wood Elf’s midriff with her arm, she bent forward, shielding Laera as best she could. The heavier objects that could do her harm bounced harmlessly off Dreketh’s armor, each sharp clang ringing in the druid’s ears as she imagined what such an object would have done to her had the shadow knight not been there to block it.<br>
<br>
What started as a procession of victory transformed quickly into an angry mob.  The rare sight of a Wood Elf among them sparked the pent-up ire of the Teir’Dal, her presence vividly reminding them of the deaths of many of their relatives and comrades at the hands of her kind.  <br>
<br>
Coming together in a resonance of hate, the crowd joined together in a chanting of Teir’Dal words Laera didn’t understand, but could guess at their meaning.  Wincing with the blow of every telling object hurled at her, she weaved her way through a gauntlet of hands reaching out to grab hold or shove her about.  Occasionally, she caught vulgar curses being shouted in the common tongue, swearing bitter vengeance to bring misery upon all of her kind.  <br>
<br>
The evil she had seen from afar only moments ago surrounded her now on every side with a wicked life all its own.  Never before had she been witness to such seething mass of hatred that burned with such uncontrollable flames.  Everywhere she looked seemed to be the scowling blue face of some Dark Elf bent on causing her pain.  Every sound was a curse in defiance of her right to exist.  Hatred raged unchecked in every direction – a raucous and gruesome hymn sung by every voice in dark praise to Innoruuk’s glory.<br>
<br>
Closing her eyes tightly, Laera screamed out loud, her gagged voice becoming lost among the drowning clamor.  The universe exploded until all seemed to join in to sing that discordant, unholy hymn to the Prince of Hate.<br>
<br>
More hands grabbed hold of her, roughly dragging her along.  In the chaos, she lost track of Dreketh’s firm, reassuring grip, unable to tell if the shadow knight was even there anymore.  Bereft of rationale, the Wood Elf collapsed inward, trying desperately to deny where she was and the presence of those around her.  She denied the shouting voices.  She denied the multitude of grasping hands.  She denied the very existence of the Teir’Dal, even if every sense she had told her she was wrong.<br>
<br>
After an eternity had passed, the bedlam finally began to wane.  The whimsical light of day was quickly squelched, and the Wood Elf druid suddenly found herself engulfed by darkness.  Opening her eyes, she glanced around to find the crowd of hateful Dark Elf faces was replaced by tremendous walls of solid rock.  No trees, no grass, no sky.  Only cold, heartless stone surrounded her all around.<br>
<br>
Two additional guards had joined their number and taken her into the shaded recesses of the cave entrance.  Glancing behind her, she saw the daylight fade away as she was taken deeper into the passage.<br>
<br>
Laera shriveled away from everything around her.  Crying out as best she could through the gag in her mouth, the Wood Elf began to struggle with her captors.  The fear of her surroundings, coupled with the fact that she had never experienced being inside such a confining cave before, awakened an irrational panic within her that clouded her mind.  She had to get out!  She felt as though the walls were closing in on her, surely about to collapse under the immense weight of the mountain above.  The air was stifling – unbreathable.  In a fury, she began gasping for breath through flaring nostrils.<br>
<br>
She cried out a second time as the rough hands of the new guards joined in trying to subdue the hysterical Wood Elf.  Hands – blue, alien hands – clutched at her, trying to keep her down, holding her prisoner in this forsaken dungeon they called their home.  It was unnatural.  Every fiber of her being screamed that she must break loose and return to the outside, whatever the cost.<br>
<br>
“Stop it!” Dreketh yelled over the din of the Wood Elf’s cries as they echoed about the stony walls.<br>
<br>
“Get her inside!  Hurry!” the lieutenant ordered in an urgent voice.<br>
<br>
Reacting quickly, the Dark Elves each took a firm hold of Laera’s flailing legs and literally carried her further down the ominous cave.  The Wood Elf’s hysterics increased to a terror-filled frenzy at being forced deeper into the blackness, leaving the beloved light of day farther behind with each passing moment.<br>
<br>
Just when Laera thought she may pass out from the anxiety, they burst from the passage into a towering cavern.  The ceiling was lost in darkness, the walls rising high above.  Before her stood a fortified wall made of what seemed to be black granite stone in the firelight.  All was dim and gloomy around her, lit in small areas by the occasional flame.<br>
<br>
Dreketh and the guards placed her down to the rocky ground to rest against the cavern wall, allowing the frantic druid to lay her feverish forehead against the cool rock, collecting herself.  The air remained thick and stifling with a moist, fetid smell of decay.  Though she still knew the mountain enveloped her on all sides, Laera paid it no mind.  At least now there was room to breathe.  The walls were no longer closing in.  Gasping deep breaths of relief, she gladly thanked any god who might have been watching that she was out of that damnable passage.<br>
<br>
“Thank you, gentlemen,” Dreketh said from the depths of her helm, trying to catch her own breath from her own exertions. <br>
<br>
“Certainly, sister,” replied one of the guards.<br>
<br>
“Allow her to rest here a while and she should be no more trouble,” the lieutenant said in a low voice.<br>
<br>
Still panting, the shadow knight cast a questioning look through her visor at the lieutenant.<br>
<br>
“How is it you knew she’d calm down once we got inside?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“You do this enough times, you’ll get used to it,” he assured.  “You’ll even come to expect it with certain slaves you bring in.  Especially her kind.”<br>
<br>
“Not that you’ll have many,” added the third guard, obviously impressed at Dreketh’s prize.<br>
<br>
“The crowd will need dispersing, gentlemen,” the lieutenant barked in an officious tone.  “Best return and help Captain N’Farre before things turn ugly out there.”<br>
<br>
Wearily saluting their superior, the two subordinates turned to reenter the passage and disappeared around the corner.  The lieutenant turned and pointed a gauntleted hand deeper inside the cavern as he addressed the shadow knight.<br>
<br>
“My tenement lies beyond the foreign quarter in the commons,” he said in a businesslike tone.  “Take her to the escarpment door on the left hand side and follow the stairs up.  I will be there after my patrol shift ends.  Two hours.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh stole a glance at the collapsed druid lying huddled against the cavern wall next to her.  Though her companion had calmed down considerably, she was evidently oblivious to the conversation at hand, judging by her lack of reaction.  Thinking back to the forest road earlier, the shadow knight remembered the look of stark terror across the druid’s face at the mention of their arrangements with the lieutenant.<br>
<br>
For some strange, intangible reason, Dreketh felt as though her commitment to the Pact was being tested.  Swallowing, she returned her gaze to the lieutenant, vainly trying to determine what his expression might be within the confines of his helm.  Searching closely for any unusual signs, she found none.  Perhaps it was just her imagination.<br>
<br>
“I’ll take her to a healer first,” she stated.  “I don’t imagine you want ‘damaged goods’ during your day with her.”<br>
<br>
“She’s a druid,” the lieutenant shrugged.  “Let her own feeble god of nature heal her.”<br>
<br>
“Look at her, fool,” Dreketh made an impatient gesture at the Wood Elf.  “She’s spent.  I don’t think she could heal a scraped knee if she tried.”<br>
<br>
“Alright fine,” the lieutenant threw up his hands.  “Take her where you like.  Just make sure she’s in my quarters by nightfall, or you’ll be answering to the whistle of my blade and not an auctioneer.  Understand?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh tossed a flippant hand at the threatening words.<br>
<br>
“Relax,” she said with obvious distaste.  “You’ll have your precious day.”<br>
<br>
Nodding without further comment, the lieutenant turned and marched back down the passageway, his metallic footfalls gradually fading as he went to join his comrades outside.<br>
<br>
Dreketh sighed and glanced around the cavern as she removed her stifling helmet.  Shaking her hair out, she took note of the guards at the gates below as they watched vigilantly in the quiet distance.  At least it was daytime and most of the inhabitants were either asleep or hunting daytime creatures.  Fortune was on their side, for they would likely have had to deal with another angry mob waiting for them inside the city walls.<br>
<br>
She turned her gaze down to the reticent Wood Elf at her feet.  Leaning down, she placed a steadying hand on Laera’s trembling shoulder and loosened the gag with her other hand..<br>
<br>
“Are you all right?  What in the name of Zek’s ire was that all about?” she asked accusingly.<br>
<br>
Laera worked her jaw and shook her head to allow the gag to fall from her mouth.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” she said in a timid voice.  “After all the shouting and the faces and the grasping hands, I… I couldn’t handle it.  Afterward, I was sure I was going to be crushed to death in that tiny cave.”<br>
<br>
“What are you talking about?” Dreketh’s voice was rife with skepticism.  “You were fine in the Tunnel of Ro.”<br>
<br>
Laera closed her eyes and turned to rest her back against the wall.  The Wood Elf’s once placid complexion was marred by blood and refuse, matching the overall state of the rest of her body.<br>
<br>
“That tunnel was much larger,” she said breathlessly.  “And I knew I could leave at any time.  You and your thugs forced me down that twisting maw, and I couldn’t do anything about it.”<br>
<br>
“Well, pull yourself together,” Dreketh spoke tersely.  Glancing down at herself and seeing her own unkempt condition, she began to brush the mob’s filth away with a perfunctory hand.  “It amazes me how otherwise civilized people turn into such animals once they get into large groups.”<br>
<br>
Raising a hand to her bruised and bleeding forehead, Laera diffidently covered her soiled face.<br>
<br>
“Just let me rest a moment.  I need some air.”<br>
<br>
“Fine, but make it fast.”<br>
<br>
Laera glanced a piercing eye up at her companion, swallowing as though doing so pained her.<br>
<br>
“Why?” she asked, accusingly.  “So you can deliver me into the bed of that degenerate in a uniform?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh rolled her eyes in frustration, making an appealing gesture to the unseen ceiling above.<br>
<br>
“What is the problem!” she asked in a scorning tone.  “Wood Elf promiscuity is almost as legendary as rabbits!  Is it because he’s a Dark Elf?  Are we so repugnant to you?”<br>
<br>
“You have to ask?”  Laera gestured angrily with her chin toward the passageway leading to the crowd outside.<br>
<br>
“Don’t give me that,” Dreketh shot back.  “I saw it in your face.  You were panic-stricken long before the crowd got to you.  Even more so than at the prospect of facing the conditioning.  Now what is it?”<br>
<br>
Laera sighed, casting her gaze anywhere but her Dark Elf companion.  Taking a swipe at the bleeding corner of her mouth with her tongue, she considered her words carefully.<br>
<br>
“It’s…” she hesitated.  “I’ve just… never done that before.”  Embarrassed, the Wood Elf glanced up sheepishly, seeing the shadow knight’s face plainly astonished.<br>
<br>
“A Wood Elf…?” came Dreketh’s aghast response.<br>
<br>
“It never came up, all right?”  Laera shot back, hotly.<br>
<br>
“I’ll bet it didn’t,” the shadow knight replied, glibly.  An amused, crooked grin worked its way across the shadow knight’s normally dour lips as she leered down at the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
Laera’s tan features flushed a hot crimson beneath the muck on her face.  Gripping her bound hands together, the druid silently pressed her lips into a thin line.<br>
<br>
Glancing furtively over her shoulder, Dreketh measured the scrutiny of the guards below.  Judging by their aspect, she estimated they had a few minutes to spare before things turned restless down there.  Leaning down, she sat cross-legged before the forlorn Wood Elf, blocking her from their view.<br>
<br>
“So,” she said, clearing her throat.  “Is this by choice, or does your god forbid it of her faithful servants?”<br>
<br>
The druid looked up sharply at the Dark Elf’s face, thinking she was being taunted for her beliefs yet again.  Finding an unusual look of sincerity in Dreketh’s expression, she bit back her coarse retort and looked down into her lap.  Reaching up, the Wood Elf wiped at the dried blood below her nose with the heel of her palm, trying her best to clean herself up a little as she spoke.<br>
<br>
“No, I told you already,” Laera said sullenly, “The opportunity just never came around.  Tunare is the Mother of All – She is the bringer of life to the world.  She would never frown on a true, devout act of coupling.  Such a thing is to beg of Her the chance of bringing a new life into the world.”<br>
<br>
Stealing another glance at Dreketh, the Wood Elf saw her companion’s face carefully devoid of expression.  Figuring it was safe, she continued.<br>
<br>
“It’s true, most Wood Elves my age have found someone to fulfill their desires at least once.  To most of my kind, it’s a lark.  It’s nothing less capricious than any other game we play.  But one time I read this passage about how humans tend to practice it as an act of love and devotion between two people.  A good number of them believe in saving their first time for someone they deeply care about.  When the time finally arrives, it is a sacrifice that they make in an affectionate gesture of commitment to their lover.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know why, but that precept touched me when I read it,” Laera continued softly, having completely forgotten about the Dark Elf’s presence.  “It touched me deeply.  Along the way, I suppose I inadvertently adopted that notion somehow.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf found herself wondering – had she been given the chance – if Rigel would possibly have been her first.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s abstracted eyes stared off into space as she listened to the Wood Elf’s words.  “There’s a lot to be said for that ideal…” she said distractedly.<br>
<br>
“What?”  Her companion’s words brought Laera out of her musings.<br>
<br>
Startled at discovering she had spoken aloud, the regret that shown in the Dark Elf’s eyes quickly vanished as they returned to their usual callous demeanor.  Her brow furrowed, Dreketh quickly shuffled her legs, uncrossing them to stand.<br>
<br>
“Well, it’s something you won’t have to deal with,” she said, her tone turning purposeful as she replaced her helm back on her head.  “We came here to talk to the priest, and by the gods we’re going to do it quickly and be gone.  The lieutenant can find his pleasure at the Maiden’s Fancy for all I care.”<br>
<br>
Sighing in relief, Laera whispered a fervent thanks to her god for sparing her – and, privately, to Dreketh as well.  <br>
<br>
With the shadow knight’s assistance, the worn and beaten druid managed to pull herself upright and stand on her own.  Her trials in coming to Neriak showed plain on her face and in her aspect.  She hadn’t realized how strenuous coming to this place would be.<br>
<br>
Glancing around for the first time, she took in her surroundings as the shadow knight led her into the city proper.  The walls of the underground Teir’Dal bastion loomed all about her in a mist-filled darkness that seemed alive.  Though all was dark and menacing, she caught sight of the occasional symbol gracing the towering walls, each one glowing a distinct fluorescent color.  The sight mesmerized the Wood Elf, who had never seen such a wondrous thing before.<br>
<br>
Being led once again by Dreketh’s firm hand on her arm, the druid glimpsed the occasional Teir’Dal wandering the city streets on some errand or other.  Fearing another outcry, she shrank away from their insidious eyes, trying to look as pathetic and helpless as possible.  Considering her appearance, that wasn’t difficult.<br>
<br>
The twisting streets and hallways seemed to delve into the cavern in endless twists as they bore into the mountain rock.  Dreketh walked with confidence, leading her slave past a number of shops and other assorted buildings.  Laera could only trust that the shadow knight knew where she was going, as she herself became hopelessly lost in the bowels of the labyrinthine place.<br>
<br>
Like so many things that surprised her of late, the Temple of Innoruuk was not at all what Laera expected.  As a monument dedicated to the Prince of Hate, somehow she had imagined it to appear twisted and corrupt.  The building Dreketh was now leading her toward made her doubt her own senses.  So much so, she was forced to ask her companion if this was really Innoruuk’s temple.<br>
<br>
The structure rising before her reminded her not so much of a temple, but of a small stone fortress, complete with ramparts.  There was even a shallow moat surrounding the structure, fed by small waterfalls cascading down the temple’s four corners.  The splashing water created an oddly soothing sound echoing about the cavern.  Laera marveled as she found her taut muscles relaxing in the calm noise.<br>
<br>
Though admittedly dark and uninviting, the temple wasn’t the repulsive structure she had envisioned it to be.  Indeed, the dark, vaulting cavern surrounding the temple didn’t intimidate her in the slightest.  If anything, it portrayed a quality of sadness she couldn’t explain.  <br>
<br>
Or perhaps she could.  Here was a race of people who were created in an obscene twisting of nature by a vengeful and odious god.  Unlike the dwarven kind, who thrived in their subterranean home of Kaladim, these were Elves – distant kin to her own blood who were forced to make their home underground, possibly because they had no other place to go.  The outside world shunned them for their sinister origins.  All things considered, was it any surprise that they chose to adopt the ways of hate?<br>
<br>
Laera found herself pitying the Teir’Dal race.  Glancing at Dreketh proudly marching the walkway before her, she cringed at the thought of what the Dark Elf would say if she could hear such thoughts.  <br>
<br>
She had to remind herself that these were the corrupt spawn of Innoruuk and devout followers of other gods such as Rallos Zek and Cazic Thule.  Whatever their beginnings, their hatred of light dwellers was a timeless obsession that had caused the suffering and death of hundreds of thousands of Tunare’s children over the centuries.  Laera resolved not to submit to her pity.  Somewhere along the way, these people had ceased to be victims of their god and became the scourge of Norrath by their own merit.  They were a dangerous people bent on the extermination of her own race, and she was determined never to forget that.<br>
<br>
Rounding the gradual curvature of the walkway surrounding the moat, they came upon a bridge that led across the rippling waters and into the temple itself.  Looking up, the Wood Elf gawked at the marble arches that gracefully towered over the concourse on their way to the open entrance.  <br>
<br>
On the rear wall of the vestibule was a large, mural detailed in red that the druid could only presume resembled the Prince of Hate Himself.  Unlike the skilled finery of the outer walls, this particular fresco appeared jarringly primitive to the Wood Elf’s discerning eyes.  Surrounding the strange image were a number of enigmatic symbols Laera couldn’t make out.  <br>
<br>
Stepping forward curiously to take a closer look, she was brought up short by the hand of a temple guard.<br>
<br>
"Halt,” he said sternly.  Turning, he addressed Dreketh standing next to her.  “No slaves admitted.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight reached up, and with a quick snap of her hand unlatched the chinstrap on her helmet.  With both hands, she pulled the heavy bronze helm off over her head, revealing her features.  Tossing her head back and wiping aside a strand of white hair that clung to her brow, Dreketh stepped up to the guard to be recognized.<br>
<br>
“Kella N’Threk,” she said in a measured tone.<br>
<br>
The guard bowed his head and backed away immediately, allowing admittance without a word.  With equal demeanor, Dreketh took hold of Laera’s arm, leading her past the guards and into the temple halls.<br>
<br>
“What was that?” the Wood Elf whispered.<br>
<br>
“The temple guards serve under the jurisdiction of the clergy,” she said by way of explanation.  Turning a corner, she led her down a set of stairs leading into darkness.  “Kella N’Threk has given them explicit orders to grant me every liberty I need in my task.  I have but to speak his name.”<br>
<br>
Stopping to turn the Wood Elf to face her, Dreketh began to untie the leather thongs binding Laera’s wrists.<br>
<br>
“Down below is a door,” she continued.  “Behind it is N’Threk’s solitary chambers.  I think they put him down here to keep him out of the way.  He can be unpredictable at times.”<br>
<br>
Finally deprived of the restricting leather thongs, Laera rubbed her aching wrists, trying to regain their circulation as she listened to Dreketh speak.<br>
<br>
“I have no idea how he’ll react to the presence of a Wood Elf,” she continued, proceeding to remove the collar at Laera’s neck.  “He’s blind, so if we’re careful he may not even know your race.  Just remain calm, don’t make any sudden noises, and unless he asks you a direct question let me do the talking.  That’s all I can think of to suggest.”<br>
<br>
On her own, Laera untied the rope restraining her at the elbows.  Spreading her arms wide, she let it unravel and fall to the steps at her feet..<br>
<br>
“Okay, let’s go,” she said.  <br>
<br>
Now that she was actually there, she felt her resolve returning.  One way or another, she was determined to prove to Dreketh that her suggestion had merit – that her presence really would make the priest open up and explain what this Pact was all about.  Somehow she would see to it that the burden of coming to this place would prove worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Laera turned to continue her way down the steps, hoping to get on with it, but Dreketh blocked her way with her bronze-clad arm and a stern look in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Listen to me very carefully, druid of Tunare,” the Dark Elf spoke intensely.  “This priest may be mad, but he is still a priest of Innoruuk.  His word is the guiding voice of the Prince of Hate, and I will not see him disparaged or in any way demeaned by the likes of you.<br>
<br>
“You stand in the house of my god, Wood Elf.  No worshipper of Tunare has walked these halls who wasn’t a living sacrifice to Innoruuk.  You are the first, and I haven’t brought you here now so you could desecrate this place by showing your disdain for any of my people.  You don’t have to believe in my ways or worship my god, but you will conduct yourself with the utmost respect for both.  Fail to do so, and the Pact ends right now with your death and mine.  Do I make myself clear?”<br>
<br>
Standing alone in the darkness together, Dreketh’s smooth features shown laced with red highlights to the Wood Elf’s enhanced vision.  Looking into the vehement eyes of her companion, there was no doubt in Laera’s mind that the shadow knight fully intended to make good on her promise.  Seeing in Dreketh the same fierce devotion she held for her own god, Laera was taken aback.<br>
<br>
Swallowing delicately, the stunned Wood Elf nodded her assent and quietly followed the Dark Elf down to the chamber door below.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The knock at the door rang across the dimly lit room.<br>
<br>
“The nexus returns whole,” Kella N’Threk spoke to himself softly in the shadows.  Raising his bowed head, the elderly priest raised his quivering voice as well.  “Enter!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh carefully opened the door, poking her head into the soft, flickering candlelight of the room.  The muted lighting cast a number of tremulous shadows all around the humble chambers.  Looking about, she caught sight of the priest’s reticent form kneeling before his personal altar in the corner, his back to the door.  <br>
<br>
Good, she thought to herself.  It meant he was likely in an untroubled mood.<br>
<br>
“I come in search of Innoruuk’s wisdom, your grace,” Dreketh spoke in a taciturn voice, not wishing to break the spirit pervading the priest’s small room.<br>
<br>
“Enter in your search, young one,” came the priest’s response.<br>
<br>
Dreketh waved the Wood Elf to follow her inside, stepping quietly into the room.  Laera shut the door behind her, the latch snapping into place with a small click.  The priest continued kneeling before the altar, his head bowed once again.<br>
<br>
Clearing her throat, Dreketh spoke.<br>
<br>
“I have brought-“<br>
<br>
“Though my eyes are forever sightless, the eyes of Innoruuk are not blind, child,” the priest interrupted sharply.  “State your purpose with clarity, and waste not our time with rubbish morsels beached upon our shore.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, your grace,” Dreketh cast Laera a doubtful glance.  “We have come seeking the meaning of Zeranon.”<br>
<br>
“Meaning?” came the priest’s questioning response.<br>
<br>
“Yes, your grace.”<br>
<br>
“What meaning is there to seek?  The Pact is.  The Cup of Ages awaits our claim.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, but what does the word ‘Zeranon’ mean?  What does it refer to?”<br>
<br>
“You speak in ignorance, child.  Do you seek identity in meaning, or that of purpose?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh hesitated.<br>
<br>
“W-we actually seek both, your grace.”<br>
<br>
“What you truly seek cannot be found until you bear the correct question to ask.  The path to knowledge is as important as where it leads.  For how can one’s destination be truly realized unless the road they travel is the correct one?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh shut her eyes, trying to work through the elderly priest’s words.<br>
<br>
“Didn’t I just-“<br>
<br>
“No, you did not ask the correct question.  For the answer is a myriad of lingual chaos.” <br>
<br>
Raising her hands, palms up, Dreketh cast a helpless look to the Wood Elf standing next to her, showing how futile it was to talk to the priest.<br>
<br>
Laera leaned in close to the shadow knight.<br>
<br>
“What was that he said,” she whispered.  “Something about a Cup of Ages?”<br>
<br>
The priest raised his head suddenly, hearing the Wood Elf’s words. <br>
<br>
“The pendant voice of the nexus reaches my ears,” the priest spoke with a stronger voice.  “Step forward and be heard, child.”<br>
<br>
Laera exchanged an uncertain glance with her companion.  Seeing reluctance in Dreketh’s eyes, the druid’s voice rose to address the priest of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
“Your grace,” she said reverently, echoing the title her companion used to address the priest.  “You… spoke just now of the Cup of Ages.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed I did,” the priest responded.<br>
<br>
Licking her lips, the Wood Elf took a small step forward to ask her earnest question.<br>
<br>
“This is not something I have heard mention of in my training.  What might it be?”<br>
<br>
The priest silently rose to stand in his hunched posture.  Turning with a shuffling step,  his opaque eyes stared a dumbfounded gaze straight through the Wood Elf before him.  Pausing, the elderly Dark Elf made as though he was trying to discern something about Laera.  Though what, she couldn’t tell.<br>
<br>
“The Cup of Ages!” the priest bellowed grandly, splitting the silence asunder like a thunderclap and making the two young women  jump.  “The Immortal Goblet.  Even more commonly known as the Chalice of Zeranon, the container which holds the whispered convergence of power.  Do you not recognize your own destiny, foolish one?”<br>
<br>
Laera’s mouth worked silently, unable to find any suitable response to the priest’s outburst.  Feeling Dreketh’s placating hand on her shoulder, she abandoned her search for words.<br>
<br>
“Your grace,” the shadow knight’s calm words leaped to her rescue.  “With respect, I have not been told of this either.”<br>
<br>
“Silence!”  The priest raised his hands out, demanding obedience.  Shuffling forward, he approached the Wood Elf standing before him.  When he spoke, his voice was tinged with suspicion.  “Of what do you seek about Zeranon’s Chalice, worshipper of Tunare?”<br>
<br>
“Well,” Laera spoke warily.  “I know nothing of its nature.  Whatever knowledge you have to impart would be-“<br>
<br>
The priest immediately let loose a high-pitched scream, his aged voice piercing sharply through Laera’s head.  Covering her pointed ears with the palms of her hands, the cringing druid tossed about, trying to find refuge from the painful sound of Kella N’Threk’s shrieking voice.<br>
<br>
“Abomination of Tunare!” The priest raised an accusing hand toward the cowering druid.  “You seek that which is not yours to possess!  The whereabouts of the Chalice will remain hidden to your eyes and the eyes of your abhorrent deity until such a time as the multitudes are prepared!  How dare you befoul the house of Innoruuk with such treacherous intentions!”<br>
<br>
“Your grace!” Dreketh’s words rang over the enraged priest’s discourse.<br>
<br>
“Speak not to me, you who have unwittingly brought us all to the brink of disaster!”  The priest turned his attention to the stunned shadow knight.  “In your ignorance, you would bring about the downfall of Innoruuk and the Teir’Dal!  Must I destroy myself to protect the secrets of the Father from your fallacies?  You who consort with light dwellers!  Begone from my sight, lover of Elves!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked aghast at the uncontrollable priest, her face mystified.  Though mostly incoherent and often unreasonable at times, Kella N’Threk had never displayed such ferocity in his confused ramblings.  <br>
<br>
“Begone, I say!  Take this abomination from the sanctum before all is lost!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh heard the quick and heavy footsteps of the temple guards approach from behind the closed door.  Reaching out to grasp at the cowering Wood Elf by her patchwork, Dreketh pulled them both away from the entrance.<br>
<br>
The chamber door burst open, swinging wildly in an arc a few scant inches from the retreating Elves.  Standing in the doorway was an alarmed guard, his eyes darting quickly between the three occupants.  At hearing the sound of the door opening, Kella N’Threk began gesturing frantically at the two women across from him.<br>
<br>
“Guard!  Take them both away immediately!  Remove them at once, do you hear me!  Remove them from the temple!  Banish them from Neriak!  For their return shall herald the coming of death for our people!”<br>
<br>
The guard sprang into action, followed closely by two of his comrades as they reached out to take custody of the intruders.<br>
<br>
“Wait-,” Dreketh held up her hands, attempting to ward off the guards’ approach.  <br>
<br>
The shadow knight’s forbearing hand was immediately seized in the firm grip of the guard as she was yanked forward into a debilitating headlock before she could make a move to defend herself.  Laera was similarly taken by another guard and both were quickly spirited away from the chamber.<br>
<br>
In her struggles against the guard’s crude handling, the Wood Elf managed a glimpse back into the old priest’s quarters.  An instant before she was taken out of view, she caught sight of the priest’s clouded eyes staring directly at her face.  His wrinkled lips were twisted into a wicked grin, an expression that confounded the distressed druid.<br>
<br>
Once out of the confines of the small stairway, the two were taken into custody of a surly ogre, apparently kept around for just such occasions.  Reaching his enormous arms around each of their lithe throats in a tandem of chokeholds, the ogre dragged them effortlessly out of the temple and into the streets of Neriak, accompanied by an assortment of temple guards..<br>
<br>
Dreketh struggled under the sheer strength of her captor’s grip.  The shadow knight pulled desperately on the arm compressing her windpipe to try and explain the terrible misunderstanding that had been made.  Her efforts were fruitless, however, as the massive ogre’s vice-like grip around her neck turned her arguments into an incoherent mass of gurgling noises.<br>
<br>
Even more frantic was the Wood Elf druid as she railed against the behemoth.  Not catching every phrase in the priest’s highly agitated tirade, she was overcome with the fear that perhaps she would become a slave after all, now that everything was falling apart.  Seeing Dreketh’s futile struggles next to her, she decided the shadow knight would not be able to help her this time.<br>
<br>
The two Elves were taken through the winding avenues of Neriak, dragged brutally before the eyes of the sporadic Dark Elves wandering the streets.  The sight of any temple guard away from the citadel was unusual in its own right, much less that of an entire detachment – complete with ogre – as they paraded a shadow knight and, of all things, a Wood Elf through the dark city.  <br>
<br>
Normally any trouble that arose inside the gates was immediately quelled by a swift blade – particularly from the likes of a light dweller’s presence.  But Kella N’Threk’s orders were clear: banishment from Neriak.  Since the authority of the temple guard took precedence over that of any other jurisdiction, the city guards could only watch the procession along with the bystanders.<br>
<br>
It didn’t take long before several members of the earlier mob outside caught sight of the small cavalcade.  Instantly recognizing the Wood Elf slave and her bronze abductor held in the clutches of the ogre, stunned moments passed as they tried to reason out what could possibly have happened.  Somehow, in the scant time following the slave’s arrival at the city, something took place that resulted in her captor being incarcerated as well.  Soon, the light dawned that there could be only one explanation – the Wood Elf was obviously a spy, and the shadow knight her accomplice.<br>
<br>
Once again, the cry went out.  Shouts of “Elf lover” and “woodie scum” echoed throughout the cavern, while demands were put forth by the masses that the two immediately be put to death.<br>
<br>
Deaf to the roar of the citizenry, the temple guards continued marching their prisoners to the city entrance, followed closely by the amassing ranks of protestors.  Though no less ardent than the assemblage that gathered earlier, the presence of several temple guards kept the angry mob at bay to a relatively safe distance, keeping the situation from flaring out of control a second time.<br>
<br>
The procession passed below the gateway leading out of the city.  Upon seeing the narrow passageway about to engulf her once again, Laera’s struggles turned hysterical.  Though her writhings remained totally powerless against the raw strength of her ogre captor, they apparently annoyed him.  With a rumbling growl emanating from the gargantuan throat, the ogre tightened his grip on the Wood Elf with a jerk of his biceps, causing her lungs to expulse in a rush.  Stunned by the maneuver, Laera’s vision clouded and sharp flashes swirled before her as she tried to remain conscious.  She knew she was still being taken back into the passageway, but her dazed state robbed her of caring.  Limply, she hung like a sack in the ogre’s grasp.<br>
<br>
Only when she felt the coolness of an outdoor breeze meeting her face did Laera open her eyes.  The procession had taken them a fair distance away from the cave entrance, stopping short at a large stone bridge stretching across a turbulent river.  Remembering vividly the treacherous swim she and her companion made through the piranha-infested waters in order to enter the Dark Elf homeland, the druid shrank deeper into the ogre’s clutches. <br>
<br>
At the command of the captain of the guard, the ogre unceremoniously dumped his burden onto the ground at his feet with a concordant thud.<br>
<br>
Hitting the moist earth face first, Dreketh rolled to one side to clutch at her throat as she took in huge gasps of air.  Choking in frenetic seizures as the air caught in her abused throat, she scrambled to rise on all fours in an attempt to stand.  She was stopped short by the boot of one of the temple guards pressing down against the top of her head, forcing her back down to the forest floor on her stomach. <br>
<br>
Hearing Laera cry out over her shoulder, Dreketh tried in vain to catch sight of her companion to see what was happening.  The guard’s boot, however, was unrelenting.  Grinding her teeth together, she resisted the pressure with all her strength and managed to raise her head several inches above the ground so she could at least breathe.  Out the corner of her eyes, she saw the captain glaring at her close by, his helm nestled casually between wrist and hip.<br>
<br>
“Pray to Innoruuk for mercy, traitor,” the captain said, his thin, Dark Elf lips curved into a detestable sneer.  “By mandate of His priesthood you are hereby banished from your homeland.  So it is now.  So it will be forever.”<br>
<br>
The unseen crowd roared to life at the captain’s words.  Whether they were cheering at her banishment or protesting at her being spared execution, Dreketh had no way of knowing.  She couldn’t believe this was happening to her.  Everything transpired so quickly.  One moment she was a devout servant of Innoruuk, the next she was marked as a traitorous heretic about to be ostracized from her own people.<br>
<br>
Stepping forward with a measured stride, the captain knelt on one knee before her contorted face.  Placing a gauntleted hand across the other knee, he lowered his face to whisper to the shadow knight.<br>
<br>
“And while you’re at it, thank Innoruuk for the mad priest’s protection,” his hateful words rang in Dreketh’s ears. “By his decree I may not be allowed to run my blade through your worthless skin right now, or that of your little ‘friend.’  But show your face in Neriak again and it will be my pleasure to demonstrate exactly how we deal with Elf lovers.  Remember this vow, traitor.  And fear my wrath should you break your exile – the wrath of Captain N’Farre.”<br>
<br>
Having said his words, the temple guard spat in the shadow knight’s face.  The warm touch of the guard’s spittle cooled quickly against her skin in the evening air, yet burned a scalding wound in her soul nonetheless.  Dreketh felt the unfamiliar sting of tears as they began welling in her furious eyes.  Losing impetus, the shadow knight collapsed with a strenuous grunt under the weight of the guard’s heel.<br>
<br>
N’Farre’s face disappeared from Dreketh’s sight as he stood, his booted foot crushing the grass before her eyes.  Raising his voice, he spoke for all to hear.<br>
<br>
“In true Teir’Dal fashion, you both will be given ten seconds of the guards’ protection to make your way across the bridge.  Once you reach the other side, you are outsiders trespassing on Dark Elf soil and free game to those who seek your blood.”<br>
<br>
Another cry went up, the voices unmistakably pleased this time.<br>
<br>
Dreketh groaned inwardly, recognizing this tradition of ostracism.  The victim being expulsed from Neriak – usually of some dissenting race from the foreign quarter – was given a chance to escape the forest.  They were allowed a short time to cross the bridge as the guards held back the violent rabble.  Once foot was set on the opposite side, the crowd was released, forcing the victim into making a mad dash for the canyon leading into the Commonlands – Human territory.  If the prey was quick enough to successfully escape the forest, they were left to survive on their own recognizance, never to return.  However, if their feet proved not swift enough, the crowd had their way with them – usually resulting in their being pummeled to death by the hands of their former hosts, or in extreme cases, brutally dismembered by those hands.<br>
<br>
Some made it out alive.  Most didn’t.  Officially, it was supposed to be a means of bringing a just end to those Innoruuk deemed worthy of survival and those He did not.  In reality, it was a ferocious means of satisfying the Teir’Dal populace of their thirst for violence – for a time, at least.<br>
<br>
Feeling the pressure of the guard’s boot being lifted, Dreketh raised her head, immediately scurrying to find her companion.  Over her shoulder, she saw the miserable Wood Elf being forced down against the grimy forest floor by another guard, firmly pinning her left arm behind her back.<br>
<br>
“Get moving!  Your time starts now!”  The captain shoved Dreketh’s shoulder roughly with his the tip of his boot.  On cue, the Wood Elf’s guard released her and stepped back to assist in keeping the crowd in check.<br>
<br>
Wasting no time to think or plan ahead, Dreketh scrambled to stand, slipping only once as she lost her footing.  Reaching over, she grabbed her Wood Elf companion by the arm, trying to cajole the defeated druid to her feet while at the same time dragging her along in a half-run across the bridge.<br>
<br>
Laera let out a pain-filled shriek at the shadow knight’s touch, recoiling her arm as she stumbled her way onto the hardened mortar of the bridge.  <br>
<br>
“Get moving or we’re both dead,” Dreketh muttered into her companion’s ear.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf managed to gain ample footing and the two sprinted their way across the bridge.<br>
<br>
Her hand pressed urgently against the druid’s back, shoving her ahead, Dreketh stole a peek behind to see the eyes of the temple guards watching them closely.  She knew they had only a few short seconds remaining before the scandalized gathering was released like hounds to their fox.  It was well known that anyone who didn’t make it to the other side of the river by that time never escaped the forest alive<br>
<br>
Turning back to face forward, the Dark Elf pressed herself and the druid even harder to reach the grassy riverbank.  Feeling the rush of wind against her face, she pointedly ignored the painful grunts coming from her companion.<br>
<br>
An instant before stepping off the bridge, she heard the raucous hollering of the crowd being released.  In a blink, Dreketh became an outcast running for life and limb from those she considered her dark brothers and sisters of the blood.<br>
<br>
“I can’t make it.  They’re too close, I can hear them,” the druid gasped beside her.  <br>
<br>
“You stop and I’ll kill you myself,” the shadow knight croaked through her sore and injured throat.  “Others have escaped before, and by the gods we’re going to be two of them!”<br>
<br>
“I can’t-“<br>
<br>
“Shut up and run!”<br>
<br>
Racing down the dirt road leading through the creature-filled wood, the two companions dodged past every moving thing they came across.  Dark and foreboding shapes whizzed by in a blur, unidentifiable in their mad rush against time.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight grimly smiled to herself at seeing the path tee off in a branch leading off to the right.  It meant they weren’t far from the canyon mouth.  They made better time than she thought they would, especially considering that the druid was nursing a painful injury.  For once, Dreketh was thankful for the remarkable agility of the Wood Elves.<br>
<br>
Leaving the junction far behind them, the two continued on their course as they sped toward the forest edge, though their momentum was becoming notably slower as they gradually lost stamina.  Dreketh began wheezing for breath, stubbornly unwilling to give her pursuers one inch of ground if she could help it.<br>
<br>
At last, the canyon mouth emerged from the swirling mists ahead.  Freedom was only yards away with no visible sign of anyone giving chase behind.  Rejoicing, the shadow knight pumped her legs harder, knowing their liberation was at hand.  <br>
<br>
Passing by one of the final trees of the forest, Dreketh saw the flash of a metallic fist as it emerged from behind the trunk.  With no time to react, she caught it squarely in the face, falling to her back in a stunning blow that knocked the wind out of her.   <br>
<br>
It was over, and she knew it.  Her vision swimming, she tried to yell for Laera to escape, but her voice failed as her lungs heaved involuntarily.<br>
<br>
Rough hands grabbed her by the lapels of her leather tunic, bringing her upright before the familiar face of the odious lieutenant.<br>
<br>
“Somehow I knew the ruckus at the bridge was all about you,” he said.  “Glad to see I was right.”<br>
<br>
Bringing his knee up, he slammed it into the shadow knight’s stomach, forestalling any recovery she might have made from her fall.  Doubling over, Dreketh heaved out in a throaty gasp.<br>
<br>
“You see, I knew that if it really was you, you’d be coming this way real soon.”<br>
<br>
Pulling Dreketh upright by the scruff of her neck, the lieutenant shoved the shadow knight’s back against the tree.  His face twisted in rage, he reached up his armored hand to pin her against the trunk by the throat.<br>
<br>
“And since the only thing I hate worse than a light dweller is an Elf-loving coward, well, I thought I’d end our business arrangements with something more than a simple handshake.”<br>
<br>
The guard reached to his belt, releasing a gleaming dagger from its sheath.<br>
<br>
“Say hello to Innoruuk for me, traitorous bitch.”<br>
<br>
In a shrill whistle of air, a steel-shafted arrow streaked from out of the shadows to the side.  Hitting true to its target, the missile pierced the guard’s gauntlet at Dreketh’s throat, penetrating cleanly through the wrist.  Crying out in pain, the lieutenant released his hold, letting loose his would-be murder victim.<br>
<br>
Reacting swiftly, Dreketh took advantage of her attacker’s distraction.  Grabbing hold of the lieutenant’s shoulders, she brought her own knee up to connect with his groin, effectively incapacitating the guard even further.  Shoving him backward to writhe on the ground, she searched for her elusive companion.<br>
<br>
Catching a glimpse of a glowing blue light near the canyon mouth, she was immediately hit by a soothing rush of power flowing through her.  Feeling the pain from her inflicted wounds wane and her strength returning, she promptly decided she must have just discovered the druid’s whereabouts.  Rushing toward the canyon, she felt the healing power surge through her a second time.<br>
<br>
Racing up to her companion, Dreketh grabbed hold of the Wood Elf’s uninjured shoulder, and immediately sped off into the canyon.<br>
<br>
“Are you out of your mind!” she yelled.<br>
<br>
“You looked shaken up, I didn’t know how bad he hurt you!” Laera returned, angrily.<br>
<br>
Cursing the pinpoint marksmanship of Wood Elf archery, the shadow knight led their way down the twisting canyon to the relative safety of  the Commonlands.  Fearing what may happen once the debilitated lieutenant was discovered by the mob, she pressed their retreat deep into the lush valley until she was relatively certain they wouldn’t be discovered by any hunting parties.<br>
<br>
Selecting a dense thicket nearby, Dreketh shoved her companion inside.  Stealing a moment to look around to make sure they weren’t being observed, she dove in herself.<br>
<br>
Laera panted heavily, cradling her injured arm as she sat.<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe we made it,” the Wood Elf swallowed her dry throat.  “I swear I could feel the-“<br>
<br>
“Don’t ever do that to me again!” the shadow knight interrupted.<br>
<br>
Staring aghast at the unexpected ire of the shadow knight, Laera’s expression turned indignant.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“Don’t you ever turn Tunare’s power on me, Wood Elf!  Never!”  Dreketh held forth a bronze fist, shaking it threateningly before the druid.<br>
<br>
“I saw the flash of a dagger!  What did you want me to do, let you bleed to death?”  Of all the things the Dark Elf had to be upset over right now, Laera couldn’t believe this was what she chose to complain about.<br>
<br>
“I was fine!” Dreketh growled.<br>
<br>
“Not from where I was standing!  You were getting the life beat out of you, you ungrateful-”<br>
<br>
“Just…!” Dreketh raised her arm, checking it as she was about to send it hurtling into the pathetic Wood Elf’s face.  She took a deep breath, letting her hand fall weakly to her side instead.  “Just keep your loathsome faith to yourself from now on, understand?  I won’t have my body desecrated by the power of your filthy, simpering god!”<br>
<br>
Shaking her head slowly in stunned disbelief, Laera stared in amazement at her companion.<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe you,” she said, astonished.  “I might have just saved your life, and here you are screaming at me over your biases!”<br>
<br>
“You can’t believe me?”  The Dark Elf was practically frothing at the mouth.  “I can’t believe that a puny whelp belonging to an undeserving race just got me banished from my own-“  Dreketh’s voice seized, breaking into the hoarse cry.  “I can’t believe my own people are chasing me down trying to kill me!  I can’t believe I can’t ever return to my home again – the only home I’ve ever known, you light-dwelling piece of filth!“  <br>
<br>
Her lungs spent, Dreketh gasped for breath with a high pitched wheeze.  “I have been labeled an Elf lover by my own family, and it’s all because of you, Woof Elf!  Damn you!  Damn you to hate’s fate!”<br>
<br>
For the first time since the death of her parents, Dreketh’s aggrieved face was stained by the flow of tears streaming down her blue cheeks.  Collapsing forward, Dreketh furiously thrust her small fists to the ground.  Her face hidden, the Dark Elf’s bronze shoulders heaved with wracking sobs, all the while her voice whispering “damn you, damn you,” at the hated druid sitting across from her in the brush.<br>
<br>
Laera’s self-righteous anger vanished at seeing the Dark Elf’s grief.  Stunned, the Wood Elf realized that Dreketh was right -- it was her fault.  In her arrogant insistence that she be right, she had brought this terrible fate down on her companion.<br>
<br>
The enormity of what she had just done hit Laera fully in the stomach.  All her life, she had been taught how her actions affected everyone around her, and not just her own fate.  That lesson returned to her with harsh clarity now as she tried to imagine what it would be like if she were in her companion’s place.  To never see the Faydark again, or Kelethin, or Rigel.  The thought sickened her, as did the thought that the grief-stricken person before her was now enduring it because of her thoughtless pride.<br>
<br>
Reaching out, the taciturn Wood Elf placed a delicate hand on Dreketh’s back.  The Dark Elf’s reaction was violent as she pulled up and jerked away, her face twisted at the sight of her companion.  <br>
<br>
Seeing her own visage reflected in the shadow knight’s cold eyes, Laera shared in the Dark Elf’s revulsion of her own image.<br>
<br>
“I’m so sorry,” she said, knowing how shallow those words sounded in the face of someone who had just lost everything.  “You’re right.  It’s my fault.”<br>
<br>
The acerbic expression on Dreketh’s face slowly faded at realizing the Wood Elf wasn’t making another one of her verbal attacks.  No Dark Elf would ever admit such responsibility and apologize for it.  It was perceived as a sign of weakness among the Teir’Dal, and seeing light dwellers do it as a sickening gesture of goodwill typically made the shadow knight want to vomit.  <br>
<br>
Strangely, however, Laera’s solemn admittance for being the cause of Dreketh’s pain didn’t have that effect this time.  The arsenal of biting accusations poised on the Dark Elf’s tongue slipped away one by one, as she unwittingly lost hold of her rage.  After all, what do you say to someone who willingly accepts the blame?<br>
<br>
Irritatedly wiping at the tears on her cheeks, Dreketh regained her composure.<br>
<br>
“What’s done is done,” she said sullenly.  “I knew the risks going in.  If I didn’t want to face the consequences of getting caught, I shouldn’t have agreed to it.”  She shrugged.  “It’s that simple.  I was a fool.”<br>
<br>
“I was a fool for thinking it was worthwhile,” the Wood Elf said bitterly, remembering the priest’s hateful reaction.  “I should have listened to you.  Now you’re an outcast and we’re no closer to finding the truth about the Pact.”<br>
<br>
“Well,” Dreketh said, her voice morose.  “Not exactly, right?”<br>
<br>
Laera closed her eyes with a resigned sigh.  She hated it when people glossed over the plain truth just to make her feel better at times like this.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
<br>
“I mean now we have another term to help us in our search,” the Dark Elf mused absently as she composed herself.<br>
<br>
The druid opened her eyes, suddenly realizing what Dreketh was referring to.<br>
<br>
“The Cup of Ages,” she said, her voice showing a glimmer of hope.<br>
<br>
“The Cup of Ages,” Dreketh said, nodding.  “The Chalice of Zeranon, and the ‘Immortal Goblet,’ I think it was.”<br>
<br>
Casting Dreketh a look of trepidation, Laera tried to gauge the Dark Elf’s feelings.<br>
<br>
“Do you really think… it was worth it?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh scowled darkly at the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
“Of course not,” she snapped, letting her companion know with certainty that she was in no way offering forgiveness.  Her expression returning to a thoughtful one, she resumed her thoughts.  “But I’ve known N’Threk for a while now.  Delirious as the priest may be, I do know he would never let slip something we weren’t meant to know.  I just wonder why he waited until now to say it.  I’ve been badgering him for information for weeks.”<br>
<br>
“And…” the druid added, softly.  “As we were being taken away, I saw him…”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf looked up.<br>
<br>
“You saw him what…?”<br>
<br>
Laera’s expression turned confused, as she searched for words to describe the disconcerting look the priest had given her.<br>
<br>
“I don’t… know,” she said, haltingly.  “He smiled at me like he was sharing some sort of private victory, as if somehow I’d been offered the dessert before the meal.  It was strange, I can’t really explain it.  What’s even stranger is that he was looking straight at me.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh tossed a careless hand at the Wood Elf.  “He does that to everyone.  I think he just likes unnerving people.”<br>
<br>
“But, what if-“<br>
<br>
“Relax,” the shadow knight said pointedly.  “Trust me, it’s nothing.”<br>
<br>
Laera closed her mouth softly, unable to think of anything more to add to the conversation.  Glancing around, she discovered that the sun had set without her realizing it.  The surrounding darkness reminded her that they needed to return to the militia house to pick up their belongings.  She didn’t know how long it would be before the Freeport guard decided they weren’t coming back and started ransacking their things.<br>
<br>
“Then it’s off to Erudin, I take it?” the druid asked, dispirited.<br>
<br>
Letting her hand drop languidly against her knee, Dreketh sighed.<br>
<br>
“The last time I asked this, I ended up running for my life from an angry mob,” she said wearily.  “But, do you have any better suggestions?”<br>
<br>
Laera looked up, expecting to see the Dark Elf’s resentful glare pointed her way.  While not exactly jovial, Dreketh’s expression was a far cry removed from showing resentment.  If the druid had to put a name to the her companion’s disposition, she figured it would best be described as “too tired to be angry.”<br>
<br>
Her lips curling slightly, Laera whispered her timid response.  “No, I don’t.”<br>
<br>
Nodding, Dreketh pushed against the ground to stand.  “Good, we’ll start out in the morning.  Just as soon as we find out where we’re sleeping tonight, that is.”<br>
<br>
“Right,” the Wood Elf agreed, amiably.  Keeping her injured arm close, she accepted the Dark Elf’s offer to help her to her feet.  <br>
<br>
Holding Laera’s hand firmly just as the Wood Elf was about to turn to leave the thicket, Dreketh stopped her with a hesitant look.<br>
<br>
“What’s wrong?” Laera asked, concerned.<br>
<br>
“I just wanted to say…” the Dark elf paused to wet her lips, obviously fighting some inner battle.  “That, uh… that… was a good shot.  Amazing, at that distance, really.  The arrow hit him dead on.  Where did you find a bow?”<br>
<br>
Tilting her head curiously, the Wood Elf turned to face her companion.<br>
<br>
“What arrow?”<br>
<br>

<br>
The elderly priest’s blind eyes observed calmly, the light of the crystal before him illuminating the intensity of his gaze.  Before his calm scrutiny unfolded the narrow escape of the nexus from Nektulos Forest.  Without comment or any indication of emotion, the priest viewed events to their conclusion as the two females rushed off into the safety of the canyon and out of the purview of his magical sight.<br>
<br>
“Disappointed?” the voice from the darkness asked.<br>
<br>
Kella N’Threk raised his eyes to look sightlessly toward the dark figure.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” the quivering voice replied.  “And no.”<br>
<br>
Returning his placid gaze to the images of the crystal – the only images his eyes could see by merit of its magic – the priest watched the uneventful landscape of the canyon mouth shown in its depths.<br>
<br>
“Their escape was crucial,” the old man added.  “But I am also troubled at their near failure.  Even more, I am troubled at their unseen savior.”<br>
<br>
“It was fortunate,” the voice said furtively.  “The arrow spared her life, and therefore the Pact.”<br>
<br>
“No.”  Kella N’Threk stepped down from the pedestal that berthed the crystal ball, shuffling his way about ponderously.  “The arrow spared the life of the fool guardsman.  Nothing more.  Though I surmise its intent was to save the shadow knight.”<br>
<br>
Casting a look of suspicion into the shadows, the priest addressed the voice directly.  “Are you certain your hand has not delved into this matter?”<br>
<br>
“I assure you, I have made no interventions,” the voice intoned softly.<br>
<br>
Grunting his disbelief, the priest returned to his pacing.  <br>
<br>
“Your words ring untrue,” he said.  “Be it in fact or in spirit, I cannot say.”<br>
<br>
The disembodied voice cryptically offered no comment on the matter.<br>
<br>
“Though time may be plentiful for the advocates of the Pact, I am afraid my own time dwindles, my friend.  Even now I feel the creeping darkness challenging me, threatening to overtake my mind.  Every day that passes, it becomes increasingly difficult to retain my faculties.”<br>
<br>
Still, the voice offered no comment.<br>
<br>
“Which no doubt brings you no end of pleasure, I’ll wager,” the old priest said, raising an eyebrow to the shadows.<br>
<br>
“I merely wonder how credible your words may be, even now,” the voice muttered.<br>
<br>
“I told you the nexus would come to me, did I not?”  N’Threk’s voice grew disturbed.<br>
<br>
“You did,” the voice relented.<br>
<br>
“And where was the first place they went in their travels?  Hmm?”  The priest placed a frail hand to his own chest.<br>
<br>
The voice remained silent, seeing no reason to participate in the old priest’s grandstanding.  Kella N’Threk chuckled to himself smugly.  “You foolishly believe my usefulness to the Pact is already at an end.  Since I am obviously myself at present, I must question if your motives are pure.”<br>
<br>
“You play a dangerous game, priest,” the voice spoke gravely.<br>
<br>
“Do I?”<br>
<br>
“You spoke to them of the Chalice, I heard you with my own ears.”<br>
<br>
“Bah,” the priest waved a dismissing hand.  “Their knowledge of the Chalice is not to worry.  They are bound to discover its existence once they unravel the identity of Zeranon in any event.”<br>
<br>
“You know as well as I do that if the forces of Tunare discover its location, it will tip the scales, making the task you assigned us that much more difficult.  Your granting the Wood Elf this knowledge brings her goddess one step closer, threatening the lives of hundreds.”<br>
<br>
The priest silently turned a dangerous eye toward the voice.<br>
<br>
“You handle the amassing of Innoruuk’s army,” he said darkly.  “Leave me to handle the Pact.”<br>
<br>
“Admit it, priest.  You felt the creeping darkness overtake you in your conversation with the druid.  It was plain you were afraid of losing control and revealing the whereabouts of the Chalice or some other vital piece of information.  There was no other purpose for your outburst, priest.  Confess!”<br>
<br>
“Silence!”  Kella N’Threk raised his hands, commandingly.  “I am still under the auspices of the Tal’Shyen.  I am still the custodian of the Pact on behalf of the Teir’Dal, and will not explain my actions to the likes of you!”<br>
<br>
“Your irresponsible actions have resulted in the expulsion of a true and devout follower of Innoruuk.  You question my motivations?  I question yours in turn.  Was your mandate to serve the Pact, or merely to keep her from my influences?”<br>
<br>
“The moon and sun rule night and day, and so serve each other.  As does intent and judgement,” the priest spoke, his manner becoming fragmented.<br>
<br>
“Speak plainly, or the Tal’Shyen will be nullified!” the voice bellowed.<br>
<br>
Crying out loud, the priest’s trembling hands were brought up to clutch at his cloudy eyes.<br>
<br>
“Despair!  Despair!” Kella N’Threk chanted pathetically.  “Sundered light and shadow!  The tears of the slayer upon the brow of the slain shall herald the unsealing of the Cup of Ages!”<br>
<br>
“Do not spout rhetoric to me, priest.  I know well the prophecy.”<br>
<br>
“Should you fail in your task, the slain shall be the Teir’Dal, but no tears will be shed by the slayer!  Leave me to fulfill your task and leave me to guide the Pact, lest the whispered convergence of power be turned against us!”<br>
<br>
The voice turned silent, leaving the priest to weather his pitiable bout of delirium.  As always, the priest’s muddled ramblings eventually began to wane, his manner turning calm once again as he gasped for breath.<br>
<br>
Lifting his head, the priest stared blindly forward in shame for his uncontrolled eruption, allowing the voice to continue sternly.<br>
<br>
“You are being watched very closely by your peers, priest of Innoruuk.”  The words echoed about the room.  “Soon you will find yourself bereft of your authority in this matter and another will replace you.”<br>
<br>
Swallowing the bile in his throat, the priest nodded.<br>
<br>
“I know, my friend,” he said sadly.  “And when the time comes I will gladly relinquish it to you.”<br>
<br>
“To me?” the voice asked, confused.<br>
<br>
“Oh yes,” the priest grinned evilly.  “Because when that time arrives, the foundation of my task will have already been laid and its destiny assured.  The only thing left for you to do will be what you are already doing.”<br>
<br>
The voice remained copiously silent.  <br>
<br>
“So, worry not about the nexus,” the priest said, his grin widening at the lack of words.  “Rest assured, they will serve the Pact for the good of all Teir’Dal, and they will do so in my way – not yours.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Laera saw it again, flitting among the trees.  Turning about quickly to confront whatever it was that was following them, the druid instantly lost sight of it.<br>
<br>
“Will you stop that?” her companion said testily.<br>
<br>
“Something’s following us, I know it,” the druid replied, still searching the trees.<br>
<br>
“You’ve been saying that since we left Freeport.”<br>
<br>
Laera shot a nasty look at the shadow knight.  “I suppose that means something’s been tailing us since Freeport, then, doesn’t it?” <br>
<br>
“Sarcasm just doesn’t suit Wood Elves,” Dreketh said to herself with a sigh.<br>
<br>
Scratching underneath the leather tunic she wore, Laera cast yet another perfunctory glance at her surroundings.   Falling into step with the cynical Dark Elf, she held out the hope of catching sight of whatever it was that kept drawing her attention. <br>
<br>
The two companions walked in the relative safety of Kithicor Woods.  Yet again, the Wood Elf found herself in surroundings that reminded her of home.  Though clearly daytime, the dense branches of the towering trees high above cut off the sun’s rays, effectively casting the forest floor into perpetual night.  Only a few rogue sunbeams managed to successfully run the blockade of leaves to shine their light on the travelling young women as they made their way down the trail.<br>
<br>
Laera noted, too, that the air of Kithicor held an unusual stuffiness.  She felt as though she always needed more air as she walked among the trees, causing her to breathe deeply and sigh on occasion, which had the effect of completely annoying her Dark Elf companion.<br>
<br>
This stuffiness lent itself to the feeling of an eerie presence about the wood that made it seem alive.  The Wood Elf couldn’t shake the feeling that the forest surrounding them was somehow aware of their presence.  Though intimidating, the feeling wasn’t sinister.  It simply was.<br>
<br>
Having this elusive shadow following them didn’t help such matters, either.  Since sneaking their way into the West Commonlands, Laera’s keen senses and training as a druid alerted her to the presence of something pursuing them.  It was always some movement seen out the corner of her eye that vanished without a sound whenever the Wood Elf tried to focus on it.  Not a single disturbed leaf betrayed the creature’s swift retreat.  Such stealth was the hallmark of an expert, meaning it was likely taunting her senses, deliberately coming out only to reconfirm its presence to her.<br>
<br>
Any reason why it would do such a thing was beyond Laera.  So far, it hadn’t made any threatening moves.  That was fine, as far as the druid was concerned, so long as it stayed that way.<br>
<br>
Soon they would be entering the rocky terrain of Highpass, where Laera fancied the really interesting part of their journey was about to begin.  The Dark Elf remained adamant earlier that morning, insisting that the druid keep her tainted magic to herself.  That being the case, she had no idea how Dreketh intended to cross through the mountain pass.  As with most places in Norrath, the Teir’Dal – particularly those who worshipped the Prince of Hate – were a reviled race, rejected and persecuted by nearly all lands, save for the Ogres and Trolls of the south.  <br>
<br>
She presumed the residents of Highpass were no exception to that rule.  Given time, perhaps Dreketh could engender the trust of the locals, but the time it would take to do so made the Wood Elf grimace.  The sooner they were finished with the Pact, the better, as far as she was concerned.<br>
<br>
For a while there, the Dark Elf seemed as though she was interested in making nice.  Laera couldn’t fathom why; she had just been treated cruelly by her own people in her banishment from their city – a banishment the Wood Elf freely admitted she was responsible for.  The druid’s optimistic side entertained the idea that perhaps the sudden loss of her people made Dreketh realize that Laera and the Pact was all she had left that she could depend on.<br>
<br>
The druid’s pessimistic side told her not to be so sure.<br>
<br>
Whatever the case, come sunrise, the Dark Elf had returned to her normally abrasive nature.  Laera fancied herself a tolerant person, able to get along with just about anyone.  But she asked herself how she was supposed to build any bridges when this worshipper of Innoruuk burned them down before the first nail had been driven.  It was infuriating.<br>
<br>
The shadow flitted by, crossing the road in a blink no less than a hundred yards in front of them<br>
<br>
“There!” Laera pointed urgently.  “You had to have seen that.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf stopped cold in her tracks, her face carefully expressionless.<br>
<br>
“Okay, so I saw it,” she said in a monotone.  “What do you want me to do about it?”<br>
<br>
Taking on her galled expression, Laera raised her hands helplessly.<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” she said, miffed.  “Nothing at all.  Your exhalted acknowledgement is more than enough for me.”<br>
<br>
Rolling her eyes irritably, Dreketh pressed onward, leaving the druid to sulk behind her.  What was she supposed to do, rush out and attack it?  Hit it over the head and tell it to leave them alone?  Whatever it was, it would likely show itself in its own time.  Why kill yourself stressing over it until it actually becomes a danger you can actually deal with?<br>
<br>
Dreketh supposed the Wood Elf meant well, but she was so high-strung.  Always questioning.  Always whining at the slightest inconvenience.  Always trying to second-guess everything.  It was enough to drive a person to troll spirits.<br>
<br>
Teir’Dal relationships were founded in mutual respect, and Dreketh found it difficult to respect someone who so constantly grated on her nerves.  Every time she extended the slightest compliment or opened up even a little, the druid’s suspicions immediately flashed across her face as though shocked that a Dark Elf could possibly comprehend such things, much less exercise them.  Adding injury to the insult, the Wood Elf deliberately got all sappy to cover up for it.  The entire pretentious scene made Dreketh physically ill.<br>
<br>
Instead, Dreketh resolved simply to go through with the Pact with reserved equanimity.  She knew it irritated the Wood Elf to no ends – she even took a small amount of grim satisfaction in knowing this.  But what else could she do?  Better that than have to deal with the druid’s holier-than-thou attitude every time she opened her mouth.<br>
<br>
Still, never before had she felt so alone in the world.  Haunting memories of what happened in Nektulos intruded on her dreams as she slept that previous night.  <br>
<br>
Hundreds of hateful blue faces had swarmed before her vision, the taunts of “Elf lover” deafening her ears over and over.  Each of the faces carried with it a separate, distinctly cruel fate.  She had to pick which among them she most deserved for her blasphemy as an Elf lover.  Running frantically through the confusing masses of her brothers and sisters of the blood, she came across a simple wooden door.  She recognized it as an exit that would deliver her from the agony of having to choose her fate among her own kind.  Frantically pulling open the door to escape, she was stopped short by Laera standing within, her arms extended in warm welcome.<br>
<br>
Elf lover!  Elf lover!  Elf lover!  Though the twisted faces had long since vanished now that she was awake, their voices continued their cruel chanting in her mind.  The words whirled ceaselessly with every step she took.<br>
<br>
But she wasn’t an Elf lover!  She cared nothing for this person she was compelled to travel with and forced to protect!  How could she love this slovenly, forest-dwelling creature who could never be anything to her but a burden?  The very notion was absurd!  The voices simply didn’t understand her or what was happening.  They didn’t understand that she was not a willing participant in the Pact.  If only they had listened to her, she could have made them see the truth!<br>
<br>
She remembered participating in past exiles, her own lips having spat the very same phrase at some tormented individual about to be banished or executed.  She remembered the exultation she felt at being a party to the extermination of such traitorous souls who would sympathize with such a hated enemy. <br>
<br>
But that had been different.  Those people really were Elf lovers.<br>
<br>
Or were they?  She also remembered their earnest pleas for mercy that went unheeded by the surrounding crowd – even herself.  She was forced to ask herself: Were they truly Elf lovers?  How would she know if they weren’t?  Had she stopped to listen to their explanations?  To this day, did her own voice ring constantly through someone’s head, tormenting them with the same words she so fiercely despised now?<br>
<br>
The shadow knight didn’t like where this line of thinking was taking her.  Shaking her head to clear it, she repeated to herself that it didn’t matter what her people thought.  She truly was a loyal follower of Innoruuk, and she was on a mission serving His will.  Nothing could stay her from that course – not even banishment from her home.<br>
<br>
Glancing up, Dreketh noted their arrival at yet another fork in the road.  Kithicor seemed stocked to the gills with these things offering no hint of which way to go.  <br>
<br>
She was glad to see, however, that this particular fork had the distinction of possessing a granite pylon road marker that at least pointed the way to one place or another.  Approaching the pylon, the cynical shadow knight grumbled under her breath about how, with her luck, it most likely announced the way back to Freeport.<br>
<br>
Her fears were put to rest, however, as she saw the words “Highpass Hold” etched with bold letters in the stone.  Below the title was engraved an arrow proudly pointing down the right-hand fork.<br>
<br>
“At least we know we’re on the right path this time,” Dreketh said, calmly pleased as she reached up to trace the lettering with her hand.<br>
<br>
“Good,” the Wood Elf replied.  “I hate feeling my way around in the dark.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf turned to give her companion a stern, quizzical look, not sure if she should be insulted or not.<br>
<br>
Laera merely shrugged.  “It’s just an expression.  It means I hate being lost.”<br>
<br>
“Oh,” Dreketh commented, casting a glance over her shoulder down the fork that was to be their path.  “Have you seen our shy friend in the last while?”<br>
<br>
“Come to think of it, no,” Laera looked over her own shoulder.  “Do you think it went away?”<br>
<br>
“About as much as I think Troll pants smell pleasing,” the Dark Elf replied wryly.  She continued inspecting her dank surroundings.<br>
<br>
“Well, if it’s still here, what put it into hiding?”<br>
<br>
“That’s what worries me.  Is it just me or have the mists grown thicker?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf ran her fingers through the damp tendrils of her auburn bangs, looking up into the trees.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know, it could be.  This place is so muggy, it’s hard to say.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight made a deep growling sound in her throat, reminding Laera of a wolf sensing that it’s being stalked.  Reaching over her shoulder, Dreketh drew her father’s sword with her right hand.<br>
<br>
“How’s your arm?” she asked, still investigating the forest.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf flexed her shoulder experimentally.  “It’s all right.  I healed it this morning.”<br>
<br>
“Good, be ready.”  Dreketh raised her left palm up before her, fingers together, thumb out.  At the whispering of arcane words, a glowing sphere appeared floating above her hand, flooding the area with a sharp, cold light.<br>
<br>
Laera’s breath caught in her throat at witnessing the necromantic spell.<br>
<br>
“I thought you were forbidden to use your magic so soon,” she whispered piercingly.<br>
<br>
“I was,” Dreketh said, squinting her eyes as she continued her search.  “My new guild forbade it.  Now that I’m an outcast, though, you’ll forgive me if I somehow don’t feel bound by their whims anymore.”<br>
<br>
Turning sharply around, the shadow knight gasped, her eyes wide as they looked into the mists.  Laera tried to follow the path of her companion’s gaze, but saw only trees and mist.  Not a forest creature stirred.<br>
<br>
Undaunted, Dreketh turned slowly this way and that, the light in her palm pulsing with energy.  Again she jerked around suddenly, looking intently into the forest.  And again.<br>
<br>
“By the gods,” she whispered.<br>
<br>
“What!  What is it?”  The Dark Elf’s growing alarm unnerved Laera.<br>
<br>
“This place is suddenly crawling with undead,” Dreketh’s  whispered slowly, her words awe-filled.  “I’m detecting undead movement in every direction…”<br>
<br>
Laera felt her heart seize.  “Wh-what kind of undead?”<br>
<br>
“Undead undead!  That kind!”  Dreketh hissed irritably.<br>
<br>
“I mean, are they dangerous?” the Wood Elf pleaded, hugging herself as though a chill wind troubled her.  “We had these weakling skeletons back home that-“<br>
<br>
“I don’t know what kind, all right?”  The shadow knight snapped, as she closed her hand into a fist, snuffing out the light of her spell.<br>
<br>
“But you’re a necromancer… you can control them, right?  They’re not a threat to you!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh cast her companion a contemptible sneer.  “Who told you that?”<br>
<br>
“I thought that’s what you do!”<br>
<br>
“You’re a druid,”  Dreketh spoke quickly as she thrust her sword into the ground at her feet.  Squirming, she worked her backpack from off her shoulders.  “You deal in nature’s living things, right?”<br>
<br>
“Well, yes,” the Wood Elf said timidly, glancing about.<br>
<br>
“So, is every living thing your friend?”  The shadow knight rummaged through the pack, pulling forth a smallish-sized bag.<br>
<br>
“No, of course not.”<br>
<br>
“Then why must every dead thing be mine?”  Dreketh replaced her backpack, urgently jerking on the straps to rest comfortably once again against her shoulders.<br>
<br>
Laera closed her mouth sheepishly.  She had mistakenly thought Dreketh was going to ask her about any abilities she possessed that could help defend them against the undead.<br>
<br>
Loosening the drawstrings of the bag, the shadow knight once again began to mutter arcane words.  Though Laera didn’t understand their meaning, the discordant sounds emanating from Dreketh’s mouth sounded uncouth and foul to the Wood Elf.  Just as Laera was tempted to cover her ears, her companion tossed the contents of the small bag to the forest floor nearby.<br>
<br>
Upon closer examination, the druid jumped back as she saw that it was a small pile of bone chips resting in the grass.<br>
<br>
Working her hands over the bones, Dreketh’s words continued slithering their way through the air.  One by one the ivory chips jostled together, forming complete bones.  In turn, the bones came together to form limbs and joints.  By the time the dark spell concluded, before the shocked Wood Elf stood a fully complete skeleton leering at her with glowing eyes.<br>
<br>
Gasping, the druid pulled away, her eyes glued to the abhorrent creation.  Dreketh’s hand stopped her with a touch.<br>
<br>
“Relax,” she said, expecting this reaction.  “This one is under my control.”<br>
<br>
The startled Wood Elf looked to Dreketh’s face and back again.<br>
<br>
“Really,” the shadow knight reaffirmed.  “I thought I’d enlist his help, in case things turn ugly out here.”  Pulling a dagger from her belt, she tossed it toward her pet, who deftly caught it in the bony clutches of its hand.  At receiving its new weapon, the skeleton let out a small cackle.<br>
<br>
Laera’s jaw dropped to her chest, her expression one of shock and dismay.  <br>
<br>
“I don’t believe this,” she breathed.  “You killed this person just to enslave him?”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight shrugged.  <br>
<br>
“I have no idea who he was or what he died from.  I don’t know his name in life or what race he was, though judging by the size I’d have to guess Human.  I’m not even sure if he was really male.”  The Dark Elf folded her arms with a self-satisfied grin.  “But his eternal rest has now been interrupted so he can help us.  The least you could do is show a bit of gratitude.”<br>
<br>
Swallowing hard, the tender-hearted druid stepped forward to hesitantly reach out to the skeletal creature. She told herself that this was once a living being, deserving of her comfort.  She imagined that whoever it was, he probably longed for the caring touch of another person after such a long time.  Her fingertips brushing the smooth bone of the skeleton’s forearms, Laera spoke kindly.<br>
<br>
“Thank you.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s gaze turned sharply from her creation to the Wood Elf.  “Not him, you idiot -- me!”<br>
<br>
Without warning, an undead screech pierced the air across from the two Elves, catching them off their guard.  Spinning around, the shadow knight cursed a bitter oath at her own negligence.  Before her emerged the half-decayed remains of a mummified soldier, its floating limbs dangling with strips of rotting bandages.<br>
<br>
Laera let out a scream at seeing the decaying corpse as it stepped from the trees onto the crossroads, its arms outstretched toward her in longing for the warmth of living flesh.<br>
<br>
“Get moving down the road!” Dreketh shouted as she grabbed hold of the Wood Elf’s armor.  “Pet, hold it off for us!”<br>
<br>
Leaping immediately into action at its master’s command, the shadow knight’s skeletal slave dashed toward the undead threat, dagger poised ready to the attack.  The mummy brought the skeleton’s existence to an abrupt end with a single backhanded swing, its fist passing through the ribcage as though they were so many twigs.  Breaking into strewn piles of useless debris, the skeleton flew apart before their eyes.<br>
<br>
Laera watched the brief conflict with a panicked fascination, her eyes jarringly pinned to the shards of bone lying on the ground.<br>
<br>
“Run, or that’ll be us!”  Dreketh’s voice broke as she yelled.<br>
<br>
Turning to race headlong down the road, the Wood Elf was stopped short by the malevolent growl of a wolf stalking toward her slowly.  Its black muzzle arched in a vicious snarl, saliva dripped gruesomely from its bared teeth as it advanced.<br>
<br>
Once again, a scream escaped Laera’s throat.  Twisting about to see what the trouble was, Dreketh halted her retreat at the sight of the dread wolf blocking the path.  As though it made any difference, she let go of the Wood Elf’s armor and gripped her father’s sword with both hands.<br>
<br>
One by one, more undead emerged from the shrouding trees of Kithicor Wood, quickly surrounding the two.  Holding forth her sword, Dreketh made as though to defend the two of them from the growing number of mummies and skeletons, dread wolves and zombies.  Turning left and right, the shadow knight poked her sword threateningly, brandishing it to keep the horrid creatures at bay.<br>
<br>
Laera shrank away in fear, her mind screaming at her to do something to help defend them.  She lamented that if perhaps she were a paladin instead of a druid, she would have the courage to stand up to these evil creatures of the dead.  Instead, the image of Dreketh’s pet being scattered like leaves in autumn kept clouding her sense of reason.<br>
<br>
“These are the advocates of Zeranon’s Pact?”  An evil voice halted the advance of the undead hosts surrounding them.  “How utterly depressing.  I had expected to lose at least half my legions to the shadow knight alone."<br>
<br>
Panting heavily as though having struggled for hours, Dreketh looked above them to see a floating figure descending into their midst.  Shrouded entirely in black with night blue trim, the man gradually worked his way down to look directly at the Dark Elf from within the cowl of his hood, his arms folded before him<br>
<br>
“I expected more from a fellow practitioner of the dead involved in something so profound,” the cloaked face practically spat the words.<br>
<br>
“Who are you?” Dreketh asked darkly.<br>
<br>
Sharp, intelligent eyes peered back at the Dark Elf.  “I am the one who is about to bring an end the Pact, for the good of all Norrath.  I am your executor.”  He began to chuckle maliciously as he spoke.  “Ironic how everyone is now indebted to Bertoxxulous as the savior of the world, don’t you think, Dreketh?”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight’s hardened expression turned uneasy at hearing her own name, the sword lowering its guard a fraction of an inch.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I know all about you, Teir’Dal,” the robed man’s charming voice continued.  “Even more than I know of Miss Nellynwae, here.  You see, the nature of a fellow practitioner of the dead makes it far easier to eavesdrop.”<br>
<br>
“I asked who you are.”  Dreketh was determined not to allow this person to see her fright.  He was obviously out of their league.  But as Nezzka Tolax often taught, there was no point in dying with a whimper on her lips.<br>
<br>
“Ach!  Where are my manners?”  The robed man’s head bowed to remove his hood, revealing the striking features of a Human.  Making a sweeping bow, he spoke.  “Kieran’s the name.  Prime Necromancer of Bertoxxulous, but I’m sure that much you could figure out on your own.”<br>
<br>
At last finding the power of speech returning, Laera spoke up.  “What does Bertoxxulous want with the Pact?”<br>
<br>
“Why, my dear,” Kieran craned his neck to address the cowering Wood Elf.  “Did Tunare believe that such an earth-shattering prophecy would go unheeded by Her fellow gods?”<br>
<br>
Having practically no knowledge of what the necromancer was talking about, Laera remained unsure how to respond.  Instead, the druid closed her mouth and glanced fearfully at the undead hosts surrounding her.<br>
<br>
Kieran’s eyes shifted back to the Dark Elf. <br>
<br>
“Innoruuk, too?” he asked, a smile slowly growing across his lips as he reasoned through the two girls’ reactions.<br>
<br>
The gleaming of Dreketh’s blade matched her hateful glare, both remaining motionless.<br>
<br>
“You truly didn’t expect to encounter any intervention, did you?”  the necromancer asked incredulously.  His eyes narrowed.  “Exactly how much have you been told about the Pact?”<br>
<br>
“I know enough,” the Dark Elf growled.<br>
<br>
Kieran’s stunned expression wavered between the two advocates, searching for some unknown bit of information.  Slowly, his face turned wide-eyed as he made his private realization.<br>
<br>
“Of course!” he said, smacking a palm to his forehead.  “Naturally, they couldn’t tell you at this stage, otherwise the Pact would be tainted!”  The necromancer began to chuckle again.  “It’s almost too perfect!  To think the only thing that could possibly bring success is the very thing that has brought about their downfall!  Well done… very well done!”<br>
<br>
The necromancer laughed evilly, his sinister voice swallowed up in the mists.  All about, the undead creatures stood silently – a contrast to their hysterical master.<br>
<br>
“Leave or kill us now!” Dreketh shouted over the perverse laughter.  “I grow tired of your useless banter!”<br>
<br>
“Oh, now now, precious.”  Kieran’s leering face mocked the Dark Elf.  “I have no intention of sending your little soul into the clutches of the Prince of Hate, as I imagine He won’t be too pleased with your failure to complete your mission.” He turned to address the druid as well.  “Like it or not, you are both puppets in the great and terrible struggle of the gods, dangling helplessly from your strings not unlike a child’s toy.  Even I refuse to condemn two people so innocent and unknowing to face such judgement.”<br>
<br>
Ignoring Dreketh’s weapon, his pitying gaze returned to the shadow knight, bringing his face two scant feet from hers.  “Instead, I decide to take control of the puppet strings myself.  Both your souls will have the distinction of serving Bertoxxulous as two of his prized undead legions.  Though I’m certain you are overjoyed at the prospect, you can save your unabashed thanks for later.  I’m certain we can find a way for you to express your undying gratitude to me once you’re subject to my every whim.”<br>
<br>
Twisting her features in rage, Dreketh brought up a hand to slap the revolting human necromancer across the face.  Her gauntlet coming within inches of that sickening grin, Kieran’s lissome hand blocked her swing, his fingers wrapped tightly around her bronze wrist.  <br>
<br>
Grinning inwardly at the necromancer’s mistake, Dreketh released the Touch of the shadow knights through her arm and into his body.  With a maelstrom of blinding red and orange light, the shock wave of her power impacted the air all around.  The ground below her feet trembled, the leaves nearby rustling violently in the limbs overhead.  <br>
<br>
Not anticipating the sudden shockwave, Laera was thrown off her feet to fall ungracefully on her rump.  Reaching down to steady herself, her hand brushed the fetid boot of one of the undead soldiers encircling them.  Drawing her hand back as though she had touched hot magma, the Wood Elf shrank away from the abhorrent figures, frantically brushing her palm on the ground.<br>
<br>
As the twisting play of light cleared, Dreketh saw the necromancer’s face – his eyes closed.  Her wrist still fastened securely in his hand, she pulled back to free it.  Effortlessly, Kieran retained his grip, slowly opening his cunning eyes to stare at the Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
“Now that,” he grinned, “will come in most useful on so many levels.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh angrily yanked her arm free of the necromancer’s grasp.<br>
<br>
“You’ve spent your doomsday weapon, shadow knight,” Kieran said grimly.  “Now it’s my turn.”<br>
<br>
Reaching his hand forward, palm out, the necromancer began voicing his incantation.  Lacking any other recourse, Dreketh braced herself to rush in with the intent of distracting him from his spell.  It was the slimmest of chances at best, but it may provide for a narrow escape if the Wood Elf was on her toes.<br>
<br>
Raising her father’s sword high above her head, Dreketh let out a loud howl.  She was about to bring the sword down when the crimson blossom of an arrowhead emerged from the necromancer’s throat, gruesomely bringing his articulate words to a strangled halt.  His voice box pierced, the necromancer silently clutched at his neck, falling on his knees to thrash about before the shadow knight.<br>
<br>
Recognizing the signature attack of her mysterious rescuer in Nektulos, Dreketh reacted immediately.  Reaching down, she grabbed hold of the stunned Wood Elf at her feet.  She knew the fight to escape the ring of undead was going to be a quick and decisive one, but she couldn’t think of anything else to do.  <br>
<br>
In the time it took for the Wood Elf to gain her footing, a ranger appeared inside the undead circle with them.  The dark and enigmatic figure crouched behind the prone necromancer, a clump of the man’s hair held in firmly in his grasp.  With a blur of movement, a dagger appeared in the ranger’s hand, its blade resting against the necromancer’s jugular.<br>
<br>
“Call them off,” came the ranger’s muttered words from beneath the brim of his shadowing hat.<br>
<br>
Dreketh was just as taken aback by the ranger’s sudden appearance as the necromancer.  Laera stared at the ranger dazedly, as though she was just coming out of a dream.<br>
<br>
The mysterious man pressed the dagger deeper against the necromancer’s neck, its tip barely piercing the vein.<br>
<br>
“Do it,” his grainy voice spoke again.<br>
<br>
The necromancer raised his eyes to look directly at Dreketh.  Seeing the shadow knight’s stunned expression, he grinned sourly.  The Dark Elf watched, fascinated as a trickle of blood escaped the corner of his mouth.  Swiping at it with his blood-stained tongue, the necromancer pursed his lips together in a caustic mockery of blowing her a kiss.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be waiting,” he mouthed to her silently.<br>
<br>
“No!” Dreketh yelled, jumping forward even though she knew it was already too late.<br>
<br>
The necromancer’s eyes rolled back into his head, his body falling limp in the ranger’s grasp.  The undead horde surrounding them fell to the ground simultaneously at the man’s demise.  Bereft of their master’s power, they no longer had a purpose for their hellish existence.<br>
<br>
Swearing a crass oath under his breath, the ranger tossed Kieran’s body aside as he might have repelled a piece of rotten fruit from his dinner plate.  Lying slack on the ground, the body began to deflate, the skin falling in ghastly folds to drape among the man’s bones.  Escaping from every orifice on the emaciated face was a black and oily mist that floated along the ground like the morning haze of the Faydark.  Crawling about in an almost sentient manner, the mist dissipated and vanished altogether, leaving the inert shell of the necromancer’s body to lie before them.<br>
<br>
“I curse you in Innoruuk’s name, bastard slave of the plague!”  Dreketh shouted at the air all about.  “You will meet His judgment!”<br>
<br>
Receiving no answer but the sound of the breeze among the trees, the shadow knight kicked at the ground in impotent fury.<br>
<br>
The ranger stood gracefully, replacing the dagger in the folds of his cloak with a small “snick.”<br>
<br>
“Wh-what was that?”  Laera asked, visibly shaken.<br>
<br>
Dreketh cast the Wood Elf a disgusted look, her hands on her hips, her mouth a thin line.  It was apparent she was unwilling to explain things.<br>
<br>
“The shadowing,” the ranger’s dusky voice offered.<br>
<br>
Laera turned to face their rescuer, her face a mask of hesitant awe.  “W-What’s that?”<br>
<br>
The ranger’s hat tilted down as he looked at the gaunt corpse lying before him.  <br>
<br>
“He committed  suicide,” he said, inspecting the body from his vantage point.  “But he isn’t truly dead.  A necromancer of the highest order of Bertoxxulous can invoke His intercession and transform into the cognizant undead.”<br>
<br>
“A liche,” Dreketh spat the word bitterly.<br>
<br>
The ranger’s hat rose.  “A liche,” he agreed solemnly.<br>
<br>
“And what do you know about it, ranger?” the shadow knight asked, her voice tinged with accusation.  “Just who are you and why are you following us everywhere we go?”<br>
<br>
“Dreketh!”  Laera’s shocked tone interrupted.  “What’s the matter with you?  Don’t you think we should at least thank him first?”<br>
<br>
“Pipe down, woodie.  Nobody does anything without a reason that benefits them in some way.”  Dreketh cast the Wood Elf a dismissive glance as she stalked up to face the monolithic ranger. Standing on her tiptoes, the shadow knight came as close to the ranger’s face as she could.  “What’s your reason, ranger?  Who are you, and what do you want?”<br>
<br>
“Why does a Dark Elf choose to collaborate with a Wood Elf?”  The ranger’s hat turned as he calmly addressed the shadow knight.  “You even defend her with your life against an indomitable foe.  How does that benefit you?”<br>
<br>
“That’s our business, and don’t try to change the subject,” Dreketh returned tersely.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh, that’s enough!” the druid snapped.  Grabbing hold of the shadow knight’s shoulder, she urged her companion to withdraw.  Stepping forward, she addressed the tall ranger.  “My apologies, kind sir, and thank you for saving us.  We really are most grateful to you.”<br>
<br>
The ranger nodded, silently accepting the Wood Elf’s thanks.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, yeah– you have our thanks,” Dreketh barked accusingly from behind Laera.  “And don’t expect one iota more.  We don’t have any money to spare, and if you think that saving our lives entitles you to anything more than our gratitude, you’re out of your mind!”<br>
<br>
“Will you stop it!”  Laera whirled on her companion angrily.  “What’s gotten into you!”<br>
<br>
“I just don’t want Mister Nimble Fingers, here, to get any ideas about settling any scores.”  Dreketh raised her head to shout over the Wood Elf’s shoulder at the ranger.  “We didn’t ask him to jump in like that, so we don’t owe him anything!  Not… one… thing!”<br>
<br>
“Relax, Dark Elf,” the ranger held up a gloved hand, reassuringly.  “I seek nothing from you or your companion.”<br>
<br>
“Then why are you still standing here?  What are you waiting for?”  Dreketh’s rancor grated against the druid’s nerves.<br>
<br>
“Shut up, and I mean it!”  Laera exploded at the shadow knight.  Shocked at the angry sound of her own voice, the Wood Elf lowered it as she dragged Dreketh several steps away to speak privately.  “Just go and do whatever you inkies do to calm down.  I’ll handle this, okay?”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf cast the ranger a threatening glare as she replied under her breath.  “I’m not letting this one out of my sight.  You heard what Kieran said – there are bound to be other gods after us.  How do we know he didn’t snatch us from the necromancer’s frying pan just to roast us over his own fire?”<br>
<br>
“If he wanted that, do you think he’d bother speaking with us?”  The Wood Elf spread an arm wide, appealing to Dreketh’s fleeting sense of reason.  “You saw what he just did.  He’d take us down like rodents under his boot.  Now please, just let me talk to him?”<br>
<br>
The scowling shadow knight took a moment to consider before nodding once grimly.  <br>
<br>
“Okay,” she said, turning to step away.  “But I’m not letting him out of my sight.”<br>
<br>
“Fine.”  Laera waved a settling hand.  “Just calm down.”<br>
<br>
“I am calm!”  the shadow knight shot back in a piercing whisper.<br>
<br>
The two young women parted – Laera approaching the ranger once again under Dreketh’s watchful scrutiny as the Dark Elf idly paced her way along the edge of the crossroad clearing.<br>
<br>
“I am so sorry, sir,” the druid spoke, her expression begging his forgiveness.  “Dreketh is just looking out for our best interests.  Really.  It’s nothing against you personally, I’m sure.”<br>
<br>
The mysterious ranger offered no comment, his face perpetually lost under the shadow of his woodsman’s hat.<br>
<br>
“But…” the Wood Elf continued, uncomfortably.  “You do have to admit, she has a point.  It isn’t often you find people who would just throw themselves in harm’s way for strangers.  At least, not in these parts.”<br>
<br>
Still receiving no response, the druid decided to extend her hand.  “By the way, I’m Laera.  Laera Nellynwae,” she said cordially.<br>
<br>
The ranger’s large hand reached out and gripped the Wood Elf’s.  The worn leather of the man’s glove felt abrasive against her palm as he accepted her gesture, his own grasp strong, but delicate – obviously for her benefit.<br>
<br>
“It is an honor to meet you, druid of Tunare,” the ranger bowed, his manner unusually cultured for one who’s profession normally separates him from civilization.<br>
<br>
“H-how did you know I was-?”<br>
<br>
“You’ve mentioned your affiliation with Tunare more than once in your travels,” the ranger answered Laera’s unfinished question.  “As well, I have observed your prowess at healing your partner.”<br>
<br>
The confused folds in the Wood Elf’s forehead cleared in understanding.  “You’re the one who fired the arrow!  You saved Dreketh’s life in Nektulos!  Didn’t you?”<br>
<br>
The brim of the ranger’s hat lowered.  Whether he was nodding to confirm her statement or making some other non-committal gesture, she couldn’t tell.<br>
<br>
“So, you’re the one who’s been shadowing us this whole time,” Laera pressed further, hoping to get some sort of endorsement from the ranger.  Not finding any, her face turned quizzical as she unwittingly echoed the words of her companion.  “Who are you?  What do you want?”<br>
<br>
“Who I am is a question I often ask myself at times,” the ranger said, ponderously.  “The best answer I can give is that I am what I do, and what I do, I do for the sake of love.”<br>
<br>
“Love?  I don’t understand.  Who-?”  Laera’s words were interrupted by the ranger’s forestalling hand.<br>
<br>
“Time is short, Laera Nellynwae,” the ranger’s somber voice spoke darkly.  “Soon the sun will set on Kithicor Wood, and then no amount of good fortune will stay the hands of the undead.”  Turning, the ranger began to walk down the road leading back to the Commonlands and Freeport.<br>
<br>
“Wait!” the druid called out.  “Aren’t you going to-?”<br>
<br>
“No.”  the ranger’s eyes peered out from under his hat as he spoke over his shoulder, still walking slowly away with a measured step.  “I have things to attend to.  Follow this road until it takes you into the mountains.  You will be safe there… relatively.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked around in despair.  Seeing Dreketh standing off to the side, she pointed at the shadow knight as she called to the ranger again.  “What about my partner?  They’ll kill her on sight in Highpass, if-“<br>
<br>
Raising his hand toward the sulking Dark Elf in the distance, the ranger didn’t miss a pace in his stride as he whispered a few words under his breath.  Within seconds, Dreketh’s image wavered and vanished before the Wood Elf’s eyes.<br>
<br>
“Better hurry,” the ranger said, letting his hand drop to his side again.  “Twilight arrives within the hour.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf looked around helplessly for her companion.  Hearing footsteps approach through the grass, she reached out with both hands to locate the Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
“Hey!”  Dreketh’s voice called out unexpectedly at the retreating ranger, causing Laera to cringe and cover her ears.  “What do you think you’re doing!”<br>
<br>
“By all the gods, will you just let it go?”  Laera’s nerves were shot.  “He just bought your way through the mountain pass, since you won’t accept my help.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf fell silent for once.  Laera could have only imagined what her expression might be.<br>
<br>
“So, did you find out anything?”  Dreketh asked finally.<br>
<br>
Watching the ranger’s silhouette disappear into the mist, the Wood Elf spoke uncertainly.  “I… can’t really say.”<br>
<br>
“You mean you can’t repeat it, or you just don’t know?” <br>
<br>
“I didn’t find anything out, okay?”  the Wood Elf snapped.  Rubbing one temple, her tone softened wistfully.  “He didn’t say much outside of the fact that the undead will be returning once the sun goes down.”<br>
<br>
“And he’s right.”  Dreketh’s voice turned businesslike.  “We don’t have a lot of time before we’re surrounded again.  And this infernal spell he put on me won’t last forever.  So, if we’re going to take advantage of this free ride he’s given us, we’re going to have to move quickly through the pass.”<br>
<br>
“Right,” Laera commented, distractedly looking off into the mists where the ranger disappeared.  Kneeling to examine the footprints he left in the dirt road, she absently wondered what sort of “things” such a man had to attend to.<br>
<br>

<br>
Journey to Erudin – Highpass - Day 1<br>
<br>
My eyes are so tired, I can barely keep them open.  What a day it’s been.  Dreketh finally fell asleep here next to the fire, so I can take the time to make this entry without her asking any questions.  I swear that woman is going to kill me with her constant bickering and condescension!<br>
<br>
It’s late.  I should probably join her in sleeping, but I think this is important in case something happens to me out here.  At least, that’s the reason Head Mistress Netheel gave for keeping a regular journal.  It sounds good to me, so I’m doing it.  Anyway, if anything here seems confusing, we’ll just chalk it up to my being half-asleep, and just leave it at that.  We won’t mention that I haven’t an ounce of bardic skill, so my skills as a chronicler will probably leave a lot to be desired.<br>
<br>
Where to start?  At the beginning, I guess.<br>
<br>
We left Freeport for Erudin very early one morning.  Dreketh was a total grouch (as always), but I guess I can’t really blame her.  If I remember right, Dark Elves are nocturnal, and that was about the time she’d normally be going to sleep.  I tried to imagine what kind of mood I’d be in if she got me up at midnight to start our day, and that helped me deal with her attitude… for about an hour.<br>
<br>
In the end, I guess it was a good thing she was in a no-nonsense mood that morning.  We made incredible progress through the Commonlands.  Since those are her stomping grounds, she knows all the shortcuts and landmarks all around.  Me?  I became immediately lost.  Everything looked the same… even the buildings the humans live in.  But we’d stop every once in a while, and she’d point out where we were on her map.  Taking it on faith, I saw we were making very fast progress without any distractions or dangerous animals blocking our way.  I have to hand it to her, for all her faults, she knows her way around that area.<br>
<br>
We made it through the Commonlands by mid-afternoon.  Personally, I was amazed.  If I were going through it alone, it would have taken me at least three days of following the paths and fighting off those fauna who would think I’d make a tasty snack.  And then there are the Deathfist orcs, but she managed to steer us clear of them, too.<br>
<br>
What lightning-fast progress we made came to a halt when we reached a wooded place called “Kithicor,” though.  Apparently Dreketh’s never gone this far west before.  Later on, after I was belatedly informed that the dismal wood was haunted, I discovered why.  But I’m getting ahead of myself.<br>
<br>
Kithicor is – in a word – miserable.  I’ve never been in any jungles like they have in South Antonica, but Kithicor is as close as I’d ever like to come.  The air was so thick, I felt like I was drowning.  Even though the temperature wasn’t all that hot, I was sweating under Rigel’s tunic.  A lot.  I never knew how rabbit’s fur can cling to you like that, making your skin so clammy and itchy.  I hated it.  Dreketh didn’t seem too bothered by it in her plate armor, though.  It must be all those years living in that dank cave they call a city.<br>
<br>
Anyway, making matters worse, we became hopelessly lost.  Why can’t people do something as simple as mark where a road leads???  Is that too much to ask?  We must have met every possible dead-end in that place at least a dozen times.  No map, of course.  That would be too easy.  And do you think the residents would say one word to me for simple directions?  I can’t believe the bigotry on this continent!  Things may not be perfect on Faydwer, but at least we know how to be polite with our neighbors once in a while.<br>
<br>
It was a really good thing we made such great progress earlier, or we never would have made it out of the forest by the time night fell and the undead arrived.  That’s right – undead!  Not just any undead like we have in the Faydark, but “undead-undead” as Dreketh pointed out in her usual charming way.<br>
<br>
Even though it was still daytime, we were accosted by at least fifty undead led by a Human necromancer named Kieran.  I didn’t exactly catch all the details, as I totally lost it.  I’d heard stories and seen paintings of undead creatures before, but they didn’t give credence to the real thing.  I was scared out of my mind, thinking that I was about to be killed at any moment.<br>
<br>
Thank Tunare Dreketh kept her head, though.  In the face of certain defeat by the intractable Human, she remained curt and defiant through the whole incident.  It was really kind of inspiring, looking back on it.  At the time it made me ashamed of my own fear.  Maybe she has a thing or two to teach me after all.<br>
<br>
We were saved at the last minute by a strange ranger who literally swooped in and killed the necromancer.  I’ve seen elite rangers show off during the spring festival in Kelethin, but I have never seen anyone move as fast as this man.  In less time than it takes to write this down, the necromancer was dead and all the undead surrounding us just fell to the ground, lifeless.<br>
<br>
Naturally, Dreketh laid into the ranger without so much as a thank you.  I managed to exchange a few words with him, but I get the feeling he isn’t the sociable type.  He did say, though, that he saved us out of love.  What could that mean?  He loves one of us?  It sounds crazy, but I can’t think of anything else he could mean.  If so, I wonder which one of us…?<br>
<br>
Well, that’s a whole other discussion.<br>
<br>
Before he left, he was kind enough to camouflage Dreketh so we could steal our way through Highpass without having to hide from every guard that we came across.  Since Dreketh’s camouflage spell was transitory, we had to rush through the hold itself as fast as we could, so I didn’t get to see much.  What I did see was impressive, though.  Not only was Highkeep there, but there were all sorts of shops and inns that I could see as we wound our way through the twisting chasms and gullies.  Maybe some day I’ll return when I have the time to visit these places.<br>
<br>
It took some time to navigate our way through, but we found the west gate eventually.  By that time it was well into the night.  So, Dreketh found us a secluded spot where we could camp for the night without announcing to everyone we’re here.  From what I overheard in the hold, there’s a huge canyon ahead of us tomorrow, with steep cliffs that will probably take a while to get through.  But we’re past the worrisome part.  At least I’m not afraid of heights.  In fact, I said as much to the Human who mentioned it, and he said that if I wasn’t now, I soon will be.  Time will tell.<br>
<br>
All in all, a busy day.  We covered a lot of territory, and now we’re paying the price.  I feel like I could sleep until winter.<br>
<br>
One thing remains more disturbing than anything else.  The necromancer we fought off in Kithicor claimed to be some sort of high priest of Bertoxxulous – the god of disease and death.  Lord of the undead.  What possible interest could He have in the Pact?  He also seemed to be holding all of the cards when it came to the Pact of Zeranon.  In all the weeks of my training, Head Mistress Netheel never once suggested that I might be in danger from Bertoxxulous, or any other deity for that matter.  <br>
<br>
It just confirms what Dreketh and I decided we must do at the beginning… we must find out who or what this Zeranon is, and what the Pact is all about.  For all our differences, we both resent the fact that we’re the chosen advocates of the Pact, yet we seem to be the only ones involved who remain clueless about it.  <br>
<br>
I’m convinced now that we must get to Erudin as soon as possible.  Someone has a lot of explaining to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Journey to Erudin – [East Karanas] – Day 2<br>
<br>
I have never in my life seen such an enormous canyon!  I’m used to passes like the one separating the Faydark from Butcherblock mountains.  The one separating Highpass from the Karanas is enormous!  And deep!  There’s a narrow mountain trail we followed that is so high that you can’t see the bottom if you look over the edge.  Simply incredible.  It took us the better part of a day just to wind our way down to the bottom.<br>
<br>
We’re both still pretty tired from yesterday’s events, so we decided to make camp down here at the mouth before venturing into the Karana Plains themselves.  From what other travelers have told us in the canyon, the place can get pretty wild with some of the creatures who live there.<br>
<br>
If Dreketh wasn’t so bull-headed, I could make our journey through this area a breeze.  As it is, she still refuses to accept any of my spells on her.  I’m tempted just to cast my camouflage spell on her anyway, just to show her she’s not going to shrivel up and die under Tunare’s blessing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Journey to Erudin – [Karanas] – Day 5<br>
<br>
Does this place ever stop raining?  I swear, if I see even one more day of rain out here, I’m going to drown!  And it’s not just any rain.  The water drops are easily the size of walnuts!  They slam against you with a soppy splash that soaks through even the thickest cloak, right to the skin.  <br>
<br>
Yesterday, we both decided we’d had enough of the rain, the lions, and trying to find our way through these grasslands without a map.  So, while Dreketh waited in hiding, I approached one of the farmhouses out here and begged the use of their barn until the storm cleared up.<br>
<br>
Not the brightest idea.  I quickly discovered that these people were more than just residents of the Karanas, but also worshippers of Karana Himself, god of the storm.  The idea of finding “shelter” from the storm didn’t sit well with them at all.  I was lucky to escape without being impaled by some farm implement.<br>
<br>
Wet and miserable, we tried again with another farmhouse.  This time, I fibbed a little and said that I had caught cold in the rain, and needed a place to weather my illness.  The farmer said I could stay in their barn as long as I hunted down and killed all the rats that vexed them so.<br>
<br>
So here I am.  Between paragraphs, I kill at least two rats that I find scurrying among the crates and tools in this barn.  Shortly after nightfall, I managed to sneak Dreketh in here with me, so it’s a little easier with her help.<br>
<br>
I guess that’s all there is to say today.  I’m hoping the farmer will let us stay here for a while, at least until the weather clears up.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Journey to Erudin – [Karanas] – Day 10<br>
<br>
I’m so sick of this place!  The storm is entering its eighth day straight without any sign of letting up!  The farmer is happy as a clam.  Not only is he getting an abundance of fresh irrigation water in his basin, but he hasn’t seen a rat in his barn for days.<br>
<br>
At least our adventures in rodent-slaying have granted us leave to stay in the barn for as long as we need to.  It’s a mixed blessing, though.  We both are itching to get out of here.  The longer we stay, the more chance that Dreketh’s presence will be discovered, and it wouldn’t surprise me if  harboring a Teir’Dal is a hanging offense in these parts.  (Everything else seems to be.)<br>
<br>
One thing the storm has done is given us a little time to talk.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is yet to be seen.  At least we’ve stopped fighting over every little detail, so that’s good.<br>
<br>
Talking with Dreketh has given me a small glimpse in the life of a Dark Elf.  Their existence is so dreary!  I couldn’t imagine living in a place where you’re pretty much denied any kind of a childhood.  From the day they learn to speak, Dark Elf children are introduced into the philosophies of hate; how it’s the source of their strength and power, and that it’s the mark of true greatness.  It’s taught to children that the pain and suffering of other races is a gospel of praise to their Father, Innoruuk.  Many, too, are inducted into the slavery of such terrifying gods as Rallos Zek and Cazic-Thule, can you believe that?  Children who are barely out of their loin rags!<br>
<br>
I’m speechless, to put it simply.  Just speechless.<br>
<br>
Before I had to get up and leave, I asked Dreketh if that was what her childhood was like.  That was when she became jaded.  From what I can tell, her parents were killed in some battle that took place a decade or more ago in the Butcherblock mountains.  I’m not up on the history of war on Faydwer (it’s not exactly my calling), so I’m kind of fuzzy on the details.  <br>
<br>
What I did find out is that the bronze armor she wears belonged to her mother, and her sword was wielded by her father.  She even let me touch the armor and the sword.  I’m no expert, but it’s plain to me that it was a skillful hand that crafted them.  When I asked about the missing breastplate, though, she completely stopped talking.  Apparently, I touched a nerve.<br>
<br>
That’s okay, though.  There are some things about my past I’d rather she not know, too.  To this day, I cannot believe I told her I was still a virgin!  I just think back on that moment in Neriak and I just can’t help groaning to myself.  Granted, I was under a lot of stress, but still… it’s not something you go blabbing about to just anyone!  Oh well, at least she didn’t make fun of me, like I know a lot of my friends would if they knew.<br>
<br>
Dreketh doesn’t seem too interested in hearing about my past anyway.  At least, she hasn’t given any sign that she is.  <br>
<br>
She’s a hard person to figure out.  Her cold and heartless exterior makes it really tough to read her body language.  But once in a great while, I catch sight of a crack in her shield, and I see a glimpse of emotion in her eyes.  It’s a fierceness that I’ve never seen in anyone’s eyes before.  Passionate, in a sense.  I’m not sure what to make of it, but it mystifies and scares me all at the same time.  If that’s what Teir’Dal emotion is like, then it’s little wonder that they keep themselves so bottled up.<br>
<br>
Well, I guess I’ll close for now.  I have a hard day of absolutely nothing (!) ahead of me.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Journey to Erudin – [Karanas] - Day 12<br>
<br>
The rain finally let up and we’re no longer in the barn.  We’re hurrying to pack our things up so we can get going as soon as we can.  We’ve already wasted enough time in this infernal place, and there’s really nothing to write about the last two days anyway, so that’s all I’m putting down for now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Journey to Erudin – [Karanas] – Day 15<br>
<br>
I cannot believe these people!  If they are not the most paranoid, god-fearing folk in all of Norrath, then I’m Pokey the Gnomish Clown!!!  Every little thing they don’t like MUST be a sign from Karana that their crop is going to wither and die – nevermind the downpour that they were celebrating not two days earlier!<br>
<br>
It was bound to happen.  Someone caught sight of Dreketh as we were traveling about ten days ago.  We decided to follow a path, since we didn’t have a map, and therefore no real means of telling where we were.  (The road markers out here make about as much sense as an Ogre who does needlepoint.)  We figured it was less risky than heading due west and hoping for the best.  (Laera, you poet!)<br>
<br>
Anyway, someone saw Dreketh and decided she was the biggest threat to king and country they’d seen since the plague.  We were taken prisoner and brought before the guards of one Antonius Bayle.  Apparently he’s a sovereign of some kind over in these lands.  I think I heard Dreketh mention his name once or twice, so I gather he’s some sort of powerful figure on Antonica.<br>
<br>
So there we were, standing in the midst of all these angry people demanding of the guards that we be taken to trial for crimes against the state!  I’m not sure about all that went on, because the accents of these Humans of the west are so distorted in the common tongue, it sounds to me like a whole different language.  At any rate, from what I can tell, the guards there didn’t want anything to do with it, so they told the people to take us to the tower down the road.  They did.  Once we got there, the same thing happened.  Shouting people making demands, non-committal guards not wanting to get involved, we’re referred to the next tower.<br>
<br>
Two whole days of this went by!  We must have had the grand tour of every damned tower in the whole area!  Neither of us could believe the fanaticism of these people.<br>
<br>
Finally we arrived at the last tower.  While we were being petitioned to the guards by the now irate crowd, an enormous pack of wolves took it upon themselves to raid the tower.  Chaos broke out and Dreketh and I took the opportunity to escape in the confusion.  Having no clue where we were, we’ve been wandering around trying to figure out which way to go ever since.<br>
<br>
I think we found our way now, but it’s too close to dawn to start out.  (I hate travelling at night, but out here it’s a necessary evil.)  We’re both tired and hungry.  We ran out of provisions two days ago and I’ve been doing my best to forage up something edible for the two of us, without having to risk any of the farms around.  That’s all we’d need is to get caught stealing crops.  They’d probably just kill us on the spot.<br>
<br>
After all that’s said and done, I think we’re both about ready to declare war on this Human nation out here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Journey to Erudin – Qeynos Hills - Day 20<br>
<br>
Well, we finally made it out of the Karana Plains.  That place is so huge with such wide-open spaces, it made me long for the protective arms of the forest.  Any forest!  Well, except for Kithicor, maybe.<br>
<br>
I just looked over my last entry, and I sound so mad I can hardly recognize my own words.  After calming down over the past few days, I guess I came to realize that these Humans aren’t so different from any other paranoid mass of people living in the same place.  I’m not happy over missing ten days of travel time (we’d be in Erudin right now!), but I just can’t stay angry for long periods.<br>
<br>
Dreketh, on the other hand has gone into a kind of melancholy, ever since the incident when the Humans spotted her on the road.  I wish I knew what was wrong.  I suppose being a Dark Elf isn’t an easy thing, with everyone hating you everywhere you go.  At least her anger isn’t directed at me anymore.<br>
<br>
Things should pick up, though.  Another traveler told us that anyone (even a Teir’Dal) can enter the Human city of Qeynos, so long as they bring with them a certifiable number of gnoll scalps.  Which is good, since the only way to get to Odus Isle is via a ship that docks in Qeynos.  He also mentioned a secret entrance to the city’s underground aqueduct system.  Such a thing sounds fascinating to me, but apparently the followers of Bertoxxulous control those tunnels.  That’s reason enough to banish any level of curiosity, I assure you.  There’s that, and it sounds really small and dark inside… not something I’m eager to experience again any time soon.<br>
<br>
So here we are, camping out after our first day of gnoll hunting.  It’s a shame they insist on being so aggressive to everyone.  At first I balked at joining in the slaughter of these creatures, until Dreketh compared the gnoll raids on Qeynos to the orc raids on Kelethin.  Consequently, I’ve said a lot of prayers over a lot of furry dead bodies today.  I leave the gruesome work to Dreketh.<br>
<br>
We figure another few days of this and we’ll have enough scalps to buy Dreketh’s entrance to the city.  Even though it’s yet another delay, I don’t mind it now.  At least it’s our choice this time, and not some crazed band of people out to kill us.<br>
<br>
It’s just now getting to me how far away from home I really am.  When Dreketh rolls out her map of Norrath, I see the Faydark labeled in big letters across the forested east side of Faydwer.  Then I see where we are on West Antonica just outside of Qeynos, and the sheer distance hits me.  So many things lie between me and my home, I get kind of choked up when I think about it.  I look up at the moon and it’s hard for me to believe it’s the same moon I saw whenever I visited Felwithe.  <br>
<br>
Everything here is so different.  Humans inhabit this place like bees to a hive.  I have only seen one dwarf and a few halflings, but that’s all when it comes to any other race.  Not a single Elf.  There are quite a few Half-Elves I’ve seen, though they appear more Human to my eyes, than anything.  It’s just not the same.<br>
<br>
There’s nothing familiar.  Tunare isn’t ever mentioned in these parts.  I’d be surprised if they’d even recognize the name if I spoke it.  Everything around me is so deviant from what I’m used to.  I guess this is what it means to be homesick.  I stop to think about the possibility that I may die out in these foreign lands, surrounded by all things unfamiliar, and it feels like someone hit me in the stomach.<br>
<br>
But that’s not going to happen.  I know in my heart I will see the Faydark again some day.  And when I do, I’ll see it with a whole new appreciation.<br>
<br>
This, I promise.<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 10 - Strange Bedfellows</c><br>
<br>
“They’re all staring at me,” Dreketh muttered to her companion out the side of her mouth.<br>
<br>
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Laera replied, her mood intentionally cheerful.  “I’m the one with the good looks, after all.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf proceeded to wave a merry hand at a passing Human, who confusedly looked behind himself.  Finding nobody, he raised his hand to wave back long after the two Elves had already moved on.<br>
<br>
“Will you stop calling attention to us?” the shadow knight growled under her breath.  “All we need is some Dark Elf hater to catch us alone in an isolated part of town, and we’re history.  Judging by the looks I’m getting, that includes just about everyone.”<br>
<br>
“Relax,” Laera waved a dismissive hand at Dreketh, tossing back a handful of shelled peanuts she’d purchased at a trading post called Sneed Galliway’s.  “You paid your dues to gain admittance to the city.  We must have handed that guard at least four dozen gnoll scalps, for crying out loud.  If that doesn’t endear you to the populace, nothing will.”<br>
<br>
“That’s what I’m afraid of,” the Dark Elf said, moodily.  “And what’s with you?  Why are you so happy?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf shrugged.  “I’m not, really.  I just get a kick out of these Humans.  It’s so funny how they react to simple, random acts of kindness.  In Kelethin, people don’t even blink at a stranger who waves and smiles.  We just wave and smile back.  Out here, it’s like you have to be some long, lost relative in order for such a thing to make sense.”<br>
<br>
Laera waved prettily to another passing Human, who scowled at her and Dreketh in return.  Chuckling to herself, the druid shook her head with a grin and popped more peanuts into her mouth.<br>
<br>
“Something is definitely happening in this city,” the Dark Elf said, forebodingly.  “This is not a brotherhood like Neriak is.  I smell the scent of discontent in these streets.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, well, I wouldn’t exactly want to live here, either.”<br>
<br>
The City of Qeynos bustled with activity all through its many winding streets.  Everything from street vendors to entertainers could be found milling about, offering wares or a song for money.  The two girls made their way among throngs of people going this way and that, all intent on getting to wherever they were going in as little time as possible.<br>
<br>
Though certainly a far cry better than Freeport, it still remained a Human city.  Outside the gates, the orchards were riddled with the customary vermin that constantly challenged the city guard.  Inside the gates, the stench of so many people all bundled together living in one place assaulted the Wood Elf’s senses.  <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, Laera insisted that there must be a certain spirit to the place beneath all the surface tension.  Intangible perhaps, but there.  It had to be.  All it needed was a small nudge and everyone else would see it, too.  They were just unused to a common, everyday show of friendliness, is all.  Laera was bound and determined to show these Humans just how far a cheerful smile could go in making their day better.<br>
<br>
At least, that was her intent initially.  The deeper they went, the more pronounced this “smell of discontent” Dreketh spoke of became.  One individual even spat a series of uncouth phrases her way for her efforts at kindness, muttering something about foreigners taking up all their local resources.  A few yards and several handfuls of peanuts later, she couldn’t help but lose spirits  in her self-stylized quest of attitude liberation.<br>
<br>
Dreketh took everything in, thoroughly unimpressed as she and her Wood Elf companion made their way south to the docks.  Glancing around at the myriad of Human-made shops and homes, she imagined that if Qeynos were surrounded on all sides by cavernous rock, it probably wouldn’t look too different from Neriak.  The only difference being that in Neriak it was the Dark Elves who cast glowering looks at the Humans, and not vice-versa.<br>
<br>
It seemed to Dreketh as if everyone were casting her glowering – if not outright hostile – looks these days.  While she certainly hadn’t expected the people of the west to welcome her with open arms, she had expected them to leave her alone, at the very least. The sheer hostility of the Karana residents had taken her completely aback.  What had the Teir’Dal race done to them, after all?  To the best of her knowledge, there had never been open hostilities between Neriak and any of the lands under the protection of Antonius Bayle.<br>
<br>
She knew her people weren’t generally liked in the vast majority of Norrath, and she accepted that, but she had never recognized the antipathy first hand.  After all, these weren’t High Elves or Wood Elves – they were Humans!  She had figured on the Human lands of the west tolerating her, if not outright ignoring her.<br>
<br>
Dreketh came to realize that she couldn’t have been more wrong, as the cobbled stone ground gave way to wooden planks beneath her feet, and the two companions stepped inside a large white building that touted a sign saying “Qeynos Port Authority.”<br>
<br>
The building’s interior was decorated in all manner of seafaring equipment.  Everything from lifeboat oars to tiller wheels graced every square foot of the surrounding walls.  Sniffing lightly at the air, the Dark Elf tried to identify a peculiar scent she later learned was the smell of cedar wood.  All in all, the place exuded a style of seafaring, thematic comfort.<br>
<br>
Behind a counter along the far wall sat a female Human, busily occupied with writing on a sheaf of parchment with a quill pen.  At hearing someone approach, the woman looked up to smile broadly at the Wood Elf standing across from her.  Upon seeing her Dark Elf companion, however, any hint of politeness evaporated like water in the Desert of Ro.  The cordial words of welcome poised on her lips were quickly swallowed, replaced by a half-hearted salutation as she lowered her head and resumed her writing.<br>
<br>
“Yes, what do you need.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked at Dreketh next to her, uncertainly.  The Dark Elf rolled her eyes to stare at a fishing pole hanging on a nearby wall.  Sighing a persecuted sigh, the druid shrugged her shoulders angrily.<br>
<br>
“We, um,” the Wood Elf started out, her manner pleasant, albeit forcibly.  “We would like to know when the boat to Odus is scheduled to arrive.”<br>
<br>
“No idea,” the woman replied, not once glancing up from her work.<br>
<br>
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Laera said, her pasted smile never wavering.  “I thought this was the port authority.”<br>
<br>
“It is,” came the woman’s curt response.  “The ship arrives when it arrives.  Storms and other unforeseen delays make it impossible to tell when they will be docking for sure.”<br>
<br>
“Ah, well, that’s okay.  When does it usually pull in, then?  Just a guess would be fine.”<br>
<br>
The woman dropped her quill pen agitatedly to look up, her eyes revealing a taxed patience.  Leaning forward on her elbows, she laced her fingers as a professor would while addressing a bothersome student.  “What part of ‘no idea’ don’t you understand, little girl?  The ship docks when it docks, no sooner and no later.  Personally, I prefer sooner.  That way, the sooner it leaves with the riff raff.  Now shove off and take your inkie friend with you.”<br>
<br>
Laera cast her companion another look.  Dreketh’s scowling stare hadn’t wavered an inch, the pristine blue complexion of her face turning a mild violet as she became flushed.  <br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s once good-natured tone turned testy as she returned her attention to the woman across the counter.   “Could you let me know when the boat last departed for Odus?  Or is there no sure way of telling me that either?”<br>
<br>
The woman’s expression became dangerous, but the indignant Wood Elf would not be staid from venting her pent up frustration at these grousing, cranky Humans of Qeynos.<br>
<br>
“No, no!  Let me guess,” Laera said, sarcasm practically dripping from her tongue as she imitated the woman’s voice.  “’The ship left when it left, no sooner and no later.  Storms and other delays make it impossible to-’”<br>
<br>
“Leave here immediately or I will call the guards,” the woman threatened.<br>
<br>
“Come on, let’s just go,” Dreketh said sullenly, taking the perturbed Laera by the arm to lead her outside.<br>
<br>
But the Wood Elf stood her ground.<br>
<br>
“Let me ask you something,” she said, placing her elbow on the counter conversationally.  “What exactly do they pay you people for?  I’ve never once gotten an ounce of useful information from a port authority on this continent, or any other…”<br>
<br>
“Leave it,” the Dark Elf said warningly.  She tugged on Laera’s arm, forcing the Wood Elf’s elbow off the counter.<br>
<br>
“It’s like ship schedules are some sort of huge secret, or something.”  The druid’s vehemence grew with each sentence.  As Dreketh pulled her toward the door, her volume increased as well.  “But you know what?  I’ve never met anyone as paranoid and outright rude as the fetid swine who live in this town!  Put that in your precious ledger, you embittered old strumpet!”<br>
<br>
The last impassioned statement was accompanied by the door swinging closed, kicked into place by the burdened shadow knight as she practically dragged Laera through the exit.<br>
<br>
Once outside, the Wood Elf broke free of her companion’s grasp, angrily jerking her arms from the Dark Elf’s touch.<br>
<br>
“And you have the nerve to call me explosive?” Dreketh hollered at the furious druid.  “What are you trying to do, get us kicked out of town?” <br>
<br>
Placing the heels of her hands to cover her eyes, the emotional Wood Elf gritted her teeth together, attempting to bridle her anger.  Weaving backwards a couple of steps, she collapsed against the painted white wood of the building.  With a frustrated groan, she bent her knees and slid down the wall to rest on the ground.<br>
<br>
“What is it with these people?” she lamented, slapping an angry hand down on the wooden planks beneath.  “Are they determined to be surly, ill-tempered cranks without getting any joy out of life?”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf sniffed derisively, folding her arms as she stared down at the rambling druid.<br>
<br>
Laera glanced up at her companion, dismally.  “Look who I’m talking to.  You probably feel right at home.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh made a rude sound.  “If you were a Human and came into Neriak all bubbly and cheery like that, you’d be getting a much worse reception.  I kid you not.”<br>
<br>
“That I’ll believe,” Laera said, raising an eyebrow to frown up at her companion.  “At least in Neriak I knew what to expect.”<br>
<br>
Ridding a bead of sweat from her forehead with an irritated swipe of her palm, the Wood Elf began to explain.  “I’m not stupid.  I’ve studied the Human culture, I know the attitude is far more stand-offish than what I’m used to in Kelethin.  I know there’s a certain protocol you have to use in order to blend in.  I was worried how I’d be accepted, so I went out of my way to be kind and cheerful to everyone I came across, hoping that things would go smoother.”<br>
<br>
“Is that what you were doing,” Dreketh muttered as she leaned down to sit cross-legged on the dock.  “What made you think Qeynos would be any different than Freeport?”<br>
<br>
“In Freeport I avoided everyone,” the Wood Elf said sullenly.  “I was fresh off the fishing boat – literally.  Later, after we left, I thought maybe if I’d made more of an effort to be nice, people would have treated me differently.  So that’s what I did here.”  The Wood Elf waved a hand at her surroundings.  “But all I’ve gotten in return from these uncivilized beasts is nothing but dirty glares and, and… I don’t know.  I did the only thing I could think of.  I guess it was the wrong thing.”<br>
<br>
Pinching the bridge of her nose, the Dark Elf closed her eyes and nodded her agreement.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf turned to glare at her companion’s condescending attitude.  “I suppose your tactic worked any better?  Glaring and sneering at people?  How many friends have you made so far?”<br>
<br>
“About the same number as you have,” Dreketh shrugged.  “Except, those who sought to do me harm respect me now, instead of seeing me as an easy target.  A show of strength will always engender respect.  Once that’s established, then friendship is negotiable.”  The Dark Elf gestured at Laera.  “Kindness is for the weak.  It leaves you vulnerable.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf continued staring at her companion, stunned at the words she was hearing.  “You really believe that?  How cynical, even for you.”<br>
<br>
“It’s just the way things are,” the Dark Elf held her hands up helplessly.  “I'm not making this up.  You saw it yourself in the way people look at you here.  I’ll willingly take some of the blame for it because of the color of my skin, but I guarantee you got twice the dirty looks I did.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, give me a break,” Laera groaned as she leaned forward to place her arms on her knees.  Closing her eyes, she buried her face in her arms.<br>
<br>
“Humor me with this, woodie,” Dreketh said.  “As a druid, you see yourself as a protector – a champion of nature, right?  The natural world is a perfect example of what I’m talking about.  You befriend nature’s creatures like wolves and bears.  Yet what happens when these predators and others like them encounter each other in their primeval habitat?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf sighed, knowing where this was headed.<br>
<br>
Dreketh answered her own question.  “More often than not, they end up tearing each other limb from limb.  Nature teaches us, better than anything else, how a show of strength is pivotal to survival in this world, and that’s not arguable.  It’s how nature’s creatures survive.  As people, we’re no different.”<br>
<br>
“Some of us, anyway,” Laera muttered sourly.  “I suppose it gratifies you to see all this, being a worshipper of hate and all.”<br>
<br>
“Let’s just say it doesn’t surprise me,” the Dark Elf replied.  She pointed a correcting finger at her companion.  “And I don’t worship hate; I worship Innoruuk.  Hate is a means to an end, a tool the strong use to gain an advantage in life to achieve their goals.”<br>
<br>
“Whatever,” Laera whispered.  She’d become dreadfully tired of that whole debate over the past several weeks of travelling with the shadow knight.<br>
<br>
Sighing, Dreketh ran her fingers through her white hair.  <br>
<br>
The two sat in silence together, feeling the sea breeze waft over them from across the empty waters lapping against the shore below.  The radically differing Elves – both in appearance and outlook – rested together on the dock, each lost in their own thoughts as they peacefully found solace in the same wind.<br>
<br>
“I need a drink,” the Dark Elf said at last.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All hushed conversation in the tavern came to an abrupt stop as the scattered patrons caught sight of the Dark Elf rounding the corner that lead in from the entryway.  In her accustomed fashion, Dreketh eyed the occupants of the poorly lit common room, sizing each one up as she knew she herself was being sized up.  Several figures caught her attention as potential trouble, but nothing she figured she couldn’t handle, or at least make a swift escape from.<br>
<br>
Laera crept up from behind to mutter into the Dark Elf's ear.  “ 'Crow’s Pub and Casino?'  You’re kidding, right?”<br>
<br>
“What’s wrong now?” Dreketh replied, nonchalant as she stepped into the room.<br>
<br>
“Are you sure there’s no place closer to the docks?”<br>
<br>
“Do I look like I was born here?”  The shadow knight walked toward the bar as she spoke.  “I have no idea, and I’m too thirsty right now to care.  I saw this place on the way in, we’re here, let’s drink.”<br>
<br>
“I’ve seen cleaner prisons,” the Wood Elf muttered below her breath as she followed.  “They actually serve food in this place?”<br>
<br>
“Only one way to find out.”  The Dark Elf arrived at the bar, meeting eyes with a grizzled, wary-looking human with an iron gray beard.  She kept her features composed and collected as she nodded in greeting.  “Got anything for two weary travelers?”<br>
<br>
The man with the gray beard wiped clean a glass as he curiously inspected the two very different Elf women across the bar.  <br>
<br>
“Depends on the color o’ yer money,” he said in a guttural tone.<br>
<br>
Sighing deeply through her nose, Dreketh reached into a small pouch resting on her belt.  Pulling out one gold coin, she lightly slapped it on the bar top with her deft, blue fingers.<br>
<br>
The bartender chewed on something as he eyed the shiny disc.  “You lookin’ te be eatin’ or drinkin’?”<br>
<br>
“Drink,” the Dark Elf replied, evenhandedly.<br>
<br>
“That there won’t be buyin’ none o’ that fancy Elf stuff yer used to,” the man said, placing the newly clean glass away below the bar.<br>
<br>
“An aged ale will be fine,” Dreketh said as she lifted a knee to slide onto one of the barstools.<br>
<br>
Laera glanced around, obviously wishing she were any other place.<br>
<br>
The man grunted and nodded as he reached up to slide the gold coin off the back of the counter into his other hand.  Reaching back up, he replaced it with two bottles and two glasses.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf arched a delicate eyebrow, silently asking if that was all she got for one gold.  At seeing the bartender toss his towel over his shoulder and fold his arms sternly, she flipped her hair casually and decided to cut her losses.  She reached out to take the bottle, but instead of pouring it into the glass, she brought it straight to her lips to take a long, deep pull.<br>
<br>
With a satisfied gasp, Dreketh set the bottle back down.  “You make a fine bottle, barkeep.”<br>
<br>
The man’s stony look narrowed.  “High praise from an inkie.  Don’t be stayin’ too long, I don’t want no trouble.”<br>
<br>
“Who, me?”  The Dark Elf flashed the bartender her most charming smile.<br>
<br>
Wiping his hands on the towel over his shoulder, the man made and ineffectual grunt and turned to disappear into a back room.<br>
<br>
“Sit down,” Dreketh said, as she poured the ale from her bottle into one of the glasses.<br>
<br>
“I’ve never had ale before,” Laera said, obediently sitting next to the Dark Elf.  “Is it really that good?”<br>
<br>
“It’s tripe,” Dreketh remarked, swallowing a gulp.  “But it’s better than sewer water for what ails you.”<br>
<br>
Shrugging noncommittally, the Wood Elf cautiously tilted the other bottle back to sample its contents.  Wincing her eyes shut at the taste assaulting her mouth, she forced herself to swallow or else choke.  Laera coughed roughly, some of the liquid having gone down the wrong throat.<br>
<br>
“Gods, this is nasty!” she said between gasps.<br>
<br>
“Isn’t it, though?”  Dreketh chuckled, tossing back another gulp with a crooked grin.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf slid the second bottle toward her companion, eyeing it as though it were the spawn of Innoruuk Himself.<br>
<br>
“Take it, then,” she said, her voice rasping.  “You three will be very happy together, I’m sure.”<br>
<br>
“Just drink it,” the Dark Elf replied, sliding the bottle back along the bar top.  “We can’t be choosy about our allies in this place.”<br>
<br>
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Laera slid the bottle back again.<br>
<br>
Dreketh grasped the bottle and pushed it more forcefully.  “It means I’m not wasting half a gold to insult the barkeep by having you turn your nose up at his brew.”<br>
<br>
“Then you drink it.”  The bottle returned.<br>
<br>
“I’m not tossing back four whole quarts just because you’re a picky drinker,” Dreketh picked up the bottle and set it firmly before the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
“I don’t recall saying I wanted anything to drink,” Laera folded her arms, sitting erect on her stool.<br>
<br>
“I don’t recall asking,” the Dark Elf said caustically, taking another pull.<br>
<br>
Laera grasped the bottle to slide it back.  “Just who do you-“<br>
<br>
A large hand emerged seemingly from nowhere and grasped the bottle, mid-slide, completely enveloping the small Wood Elf’s hand.  Following the muscular, hairy arm with her eyes, Laera looked over her shoulder to find that a large Human male had approached them from behind.  <br>
<br>
“The lady’s sayin’ she’s not wantin’ ale,” his baritone voice said.  “I’m suggestin’ you back off and leave her to be makin’ her own order.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s cool, azure gaze slid to the corners of her eyes, looking at this newcomer with a furtive glance as she drank.  Like most Humans, the man stood two good handwidths taller than any Teir’Dal.  A mass of dishwater blond hair, cropped short, refined his chiseled features.  The arm that reached out to grasp hold of the bottle rippled with a generous assortment of lean muscles.  Lean for a Human, that is.  Few Elves, even with the most rigorous exercise, could develop muscles of this man’s bulk.  <br>
<br>
The Human’s attire was well-to-do without being exorbitant.  His tunic was white cotton, covered by a dark satin vest and complemented by mildly careworn rawhide trousers.<br>
<br>
Blinking her eyes languidly as she set her glass back on the counter, Dreketh poured more Ale for herself as she spoke.  “And you are..?”<br>
<br>
“I’m the one tellin’ you to back off,” the man said.  “That’s all you need to be knowin’, inkie.  I don’t much care for the likes of your kind, so adjust the attitude or I’m gonna be the one adjustin’ it for you.”<br>
<br>
Loosening his grip on the bottle, the man’s solid hand twisted agilely to take Laera’s with a surprisingly gentle touch.  An affable grin spread across his face as he turned to address the meek Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
“How would you be likin’ to order anythin’ you want?”  he asked amiably.  He tossed his head at one of the tables, presumably at the one he'd been sitting.  “Food, drink; you name it.  If you’ll be joinin’ me, it’ll be my treat.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” the Wood Elf spoke with blithe elegance.  “I believe I will.”<br>
<br>
Laera cast her Dark Elf companion a disdainful look as she lowered her foot to gracefully step off the barstool.  With accustomed ease, the druid allowed herself to be led to the man’s table by his firm hand.  With a refined bearing, the Wood Elf seated herself, followed by the Human.<br>
<br>
Before the man, rested a flagon of some unknown concoction that he had been drinking, along with a small traveling pack and a wooden staff leaning against the edge of the table.<br>
<br>
“So, what’s yer name bein’?” the man asked, leaning in close.<br>
<br>
“Laera Nellynwae,” the Wood Elf said with a smile.<br>
<br>
The man closed his eyes with a winsome smile, in an exaggerated display of bliss.  <br>
<br>
“Mmmmm, those Elf names are musical,” he said, leading Laera down into a chair at the table.  “I’m just plain old ‘Jaden Garrick.’”<br>
<br>
“A pleasure to meet you, Jaden,” Laera said cordially.<br>
<br>
“I assure you, the pleasure’s bein’ all mine to come to the rescue of such a lovely lady.  Those Teir’Dal have no sense of socialness – not even them women!”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf grinned and looked down self-consciously at the man’s compliment.<br>
<br>
Reaching up a hand to hail the barmaid, Jaden let out a loud whistle that echoed throughout the muted room.  Stepping up to the table with a tolerant look, the waitress asked what she could do for him.  Without ado or comment, the man gestured an open hand for Laera to speak.<br>
<br>
“Y-you’ve been so kind already,” she said timidly.  “I’d hate to impose myself.”<br>
<br>
“Nonsense,” Jaden replied, gruffly.  “We Humans have a saying.  Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.”<br>
<br>
Casting the man a slightly confused look, Laera gently made an order of a glass of Elven wine and vegetable stew.<br>
<br>
“So, how is it a Wood Elf has come to be travellin’ with one of them?” Jaden asked casually once the waitress left to fill the order.<br>
<br>
“Believe me, you don’t want to know,” Laera rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
The Human’s brow furrowed suddenly as he leaned in to speak confidentially.  “Yer not one of them slaves they’re keepin’ are ye?”<br>
<br>
“Oh, no!” Laera placed a placating hand on Jaden’s arm.  Thinking over the matter, she chuckled to herself softly.  “Well, not as such.  I guess you could say we’re both prisoners of each other, but that’s a long and boring tale.  How about you, what’s your story?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh glanced over her shoulder, keeping an eye on Human and Elf alike as they carried on their private conversation across the candlelit room.  From her vantage point, all she could make out were the fidgety motions of small talk taking place between the two.  Occasionally, the Human would make a flirtatious  brush against Laera’s arm or shoulder, but nothing that seemed overtly threatening to the Dark Elf.  Taking a brief circuit of the other tavern patrons, she was satisfied to find nobody else taking an undue interest in the coquetry at the table.<br>
<br>
Soon, the barmaid returned to deliver Laera’s order, making the Dark Elf’s stomach growl for something other than the bland-tasting rations she'd been forced to eat for the past several days.  Feeling the lightness of the money purse on her belt, Dreketh somberly took both bottles and her glass to a table off in the corner where she would be left in peace.<br>
<br>
Laera looked up from her steaming bowl to see the bronze-clad Dark Elf step to the corner table, her silhouette black against the flaming lamp.  A pang of guilt tugged at the druid's conscience for being treated to an actual meal, while her companion went without.  Then the she reminded herself that this was Dreketh’s own doing.  Perhaps now she would see the fatal flaw in her cavalier approach to dealing with others.<br>
<br>
With a small shrug, the Wood Elf enjoyed her stew with complacency as the Dark Elf’s eyes watched her grimly from the shadows.  After all, if Dreketh wanted to drown herself in that foul-tasting drink, then so be it.  Four weeks’ travel with a Teir’Dal was enough to make a kobold lose its fur, and Laera figured it was about time she did things her own way for a change.<br>
<br>
“So, is it true what they’re sayin’ about Wood Elves?” Jaden’s question brought Laera out of her musings.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry?” the Wood Elf asked, cocking her head to one side.<br>
<br>
“Are the females as, erm… ‘limber’ as rumors are havin’ it?”  The Human leered.<br>
<br>
Laera’s smile froze uncertainly.  “I’m… not sure what you mean.”<br>
<br>
“Come on,” Jaden drawled teasingly.  “You must have heard this… Everyone has.”<br>
<br>
“Y-yeah, well,”  Laera swallowed, uncomfortably.  “Not all Wood Elves are the same.”<br>
<br>
“Ah, I see.  I see.”  The Human lowered his voice and spoke with a wink.  “So, which kind are you bein’?”<br>
<br>
“Well I, um.  Heh…”  Blushing prettily, the flustered Wood Elf was at a loss for words.<br>
<br>
“I’ll bet you’ve got a long trail of men stretchin’ from here all the way to Faydwer, all sittin’ up and beggin’ like poor hounds to a fresh cut steak, am I right?  Probably a few broken hearts, too, if I’m not bein’ mistaken.”<br>
<br>
Running her fingertips over her pointed ear to sweep back a deviant strand of hair, the Wood Elf tilted her head with a creased brow.<br>
<br>
“Not… as many as you’d… probably think,” she said haltingly with an apprehensive smile.<br>
<br>
“Modesty in a Wood Elf.  Will wonders never cease?”  Jaden grabbed hold of his flagon, raising it off the table as he spoke in an undertone.  “And pretty damned sexy if you ask me.”<br>
<br>
While the Human tossed back a quaff of his drink, Laera cast an uncertain glance across the room to the corner where Dreketh sat.  The Dark Elf sat with her feet propped casually on the tabletop, apparently absorbed in her own thoughts as she nursed her drink.<br>
<br>
“You’ve heard the one about the naked Wood Elf and the Ogre with the wheelbarrow, haven’t you?’  Jaden asked, setting his drink heavily back in place.<br>
<br>
“No, I… I mean yes!  Yes, I have,” Laera made a false attempt at laughing as she brought her goblet to her lips.  “That’s… a really good one.  Mmm hmm.”<br>
<br>
The disconcerted Wood Elf took a long, bracing drink – mostly to avoid having to comment on what was obviously a crude joke she’d never heard before in her life.  Nor did she care to hear it now.<br>
<br>
“Some uncultured buboes ‘round these part are sayin’ that it’s bein’ a true story, can you believe that?”  <br>
<br>
Laera swallowed.  “No, I-“<br>
<br>
“It’s ridiculous, ain't it?”  Jaden continued, unabated.  “I mean, how would she keep her feet from falling asleep?”<br>
<br>
“Jaden…”  Laera had had about enough.<br>
<br>
The Human raised a stopping hand.  “I know, I know.  I’ve heard that Wood Elf females are agile, but if ye be askin’ me, I don’t think any-“<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, but I have a boat to catch.”  The Wood Elf dabbed at her lips with her linen napkin, pushing aside the half empty bowl before her.  “I really need to be going now.  Thank you for the kind meal.”<br>
<br>
“What?”  Jaden seemed genuinely surprised.  “You haven’t even finished eatin’ yer stew.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, it filled me up fast,” Laera lied as she placed a hand over her midriff.  “I couldn’t eat another bite, no matter how delicious.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf made to stand and take her leave, halted short by the Human’s hand covering hers, trapping it against the tabletop.<br>
<br>
“I’m not understandin’,” he said, perplexed.  “I thought all you Wood Elves knew the score.”<br>
<br>
“Excuse me?”  Laera’s eyes narrowed, trying desperately to overrule her instinct to jerk her hand away.<br>
<br>
“It’s not polite to eat and run.”  The amiable look in Jaden’s eyes faded to a baleful leer.  “Now, I’ve been showin’ ye my common courtesy in providin’ lunch and teachin’ you about Human ways.”  His strong hand grasped hold of Laera’s, turning it palm up to caress it with his other hand as he traced a small path with his fingertips down to her wrist..  “The least you could do is show me your gratitude by teachin’ me about… Wood Elf ways.”<br>
<br>
The Human’s once conciliatory touch suddenly sent an icy chill up Laera’s spine, making her skin crawl.  It was a sensation the young druid had never felt before.  While she held an aversion to Dreketh’s touch because of the Dark Elf’s alien nature, the feel of Jaden’s rough hand as it crept its way slowly along the underside of her forearm filled her with abhorrent loathing.<br>
<br>
Laera felt herself flushing hotly.  She had previously thought that her unique – some would term “bizarre” – modesty among Wood Elves was an adoption of Human custom.  Apparently she still had a lot to learn about Humans after all.<br>
<br>
“I told you already,” she said, gently pulling her arm away from the man’s groping hands.  “Not all Wood Elves are the same.”<br>
<br>
“Aren’t all Wood Elves understandin’ proper etiquette?”  Jaden asked tersely.  “You don’t want fair-minded people to start thinkin’ your kind are impolite by ignorin’ the quid-pro-quo, do you now?”<br>
<br>
Somehow the Human had unobtrusively reached his hand under the table to place it expertly on Laera’s thigh.  Feeling her abdomen muscles quiver violently at the unexpected touch, the Wood Elf involuntarily jerked back, upsetting the table and spilling the contents of her wineglass.  The man’s wooden staff fell to the floor with a jarring clang, immediately catching the full attention of neighboring patrons.<br>
<br>
Trembling violently, Laera reached up with one hand to set the glass correctly on its base while her other hand quickly dabbed at the spilled wine before it reached its way to the edge of the table.  Her efforts were in vain, however, as the napkin’s pressure inadvertently pushed the crimson liquid even farther along, causing it to pour onto the man’s white shirt and satin vest.<br>
<br>
Jaden’s hand was instantly removed from the Wood Elf’s leg.  At the sight of the red stain spreading across his clothes, the Human swore an ill-mannered oath as he grabbed his own napkin and swiped futilely at the offending wine.  Having no success, he stood in a half-crouch, the back of his knees causing his chair to scrape along the floor noisily behind him.<br>
<br>
Laera stood as well, attempting to help the distraught Human.  Instead, her wrist was caught solidly in his firm grasp.  Looking up, her eyes met his enraged glare.<br>
<br>
“You clumsy little whore,” he spat, loudly.  “You think you can be teasin’ your way to a free meal and just up and leave?  Why, I should take-“<br>
<br>
The man’s words were cut short at the feeling of cold, sharp steel bring pressed against his neck.<br>
<br>
“You were saying?”  Dreketh’s menacing voice met the Human’s ears, the sound of it feeling even colder than the touch of her blade.<br>
<br>
Freezing in place, Jaden glanced from the doting Wood Elf to look down the Dark Elf’s long, steel weapon to focus on Dreketh’s menacing face at the other end.  One small flick of the shadow knight’s wrist, and Jaden would be in urgent need of a healer before he bled to death.  Fully realizing this, he released his tight hold on the Wood Elf’s wrist.<br>
<br>
“What’s the ruckus out here!” the bartender bellowed as he stepped out from the back room.<br>
<br>
Amidst the distraction, Jaden tossed his head back, freeing his neck from the blade’s threat.  In one swift motion, he brought his arm up to parry the sword and kicked at the Dark Elf’s torso, sending her reeling back into a neighboring table.<br>
<br>
Turning quickly, the Human reached for his fallen staff on the floor, only to find nothing but empty wooden planks.  Casting about in search of his weapon, Jaden brought his gaze up to catch a glimpse of something fast and hard as it connected with his face.  <br>
<br>
He’d unwittingly discovered what became of his missing staff.<br>
<br>
Intense flashes of light clouded his eyes.  His head whipped to one side, overextending his neck painfully.  Falling on his knees, the stunned man tried his best to keep from falling to the floor by grabbing hold of a nearby chair.  Wobbling precariously on his knees, the defenseless Human was in no position to avoid losing his footing as the Laera brought the staff down on his lower back, plunging its steel tip to impact against his left kidney.<br>
<br>
The man collapsed in a useless heap, his strangled cry sounding loudly through the common room.  Crouched over in pain, Jaden fought to breathe – fighting as best he could against the shooting pain in his flank. <br>
<br>
The pain intensified tenfold as two blue hands grasped hold of his vest and yanked him to his feet.  The world weaved violently around him as he was forced down against the top of his table, scattering its contents.  Incapacitated, he felt the warm touch of the shadow knight’s palm as she grasped tightly at his windpipe.  <br>
<br>
“You think you can just claim a soft, unassuming girl for your own pleasure?”  Dreketh growled softly into his hear.  “Just because you paid for a petty glass of wine and rancid stew, you think that entitles you her ownership?  You think you deserve something in return?”<br>
<br>
The Human grasped at the shadow knight’s strangling hand.  Her grip tightened in response.<br>
<br>
“Do you!” the Dark Elf suddenly shouted in the man’s ear, causing him to grimace even more.  “We may be small.  We may be soft.  We may seem like smaller versions of your females, tailor made for your pleasure, but Elves are not yours to play with!  You got that!”<br>
<br>
The struggling Human pulled weakly at the shadow knight’s pinching gauntlets, which only served to tighten her grip even more.  <br>
<br>
Standing off to the side, still holding Jaden’s staff, Laera watched the Human’s eyes crack open to look at the enraged Teir’Dal pinning him to the table.  His eyes glimmered brightly in the candlelight as they turned her way in terror.  <br>
<br>
Curious at the man’s extreme reaction, Laera leaned over to see her companion, finding the face of someone she didn’t know.  Dreketh’s normally smooth, dour features shown like a person gone insane.  Her teeth clenched together shown stark white against her dark, thin lips.  Her nose curled in a twisted sneer of unchecked fury.  Her eyes blazed, filled with hateful death aimed at the pathetic excuse for a man she held in her clutches.<br>
<br>
One small release of the shadow knight’s Touch, and the Human’s life would be no more.<br>
<br>
Laera placed a cautious hand on her companion’s shoulder.  To her surprise, she found it shaking subtlety beneath the bronze armor, as if the Dark Elf was using every ounce of strength to restrain herself.<br>
<br>
“You need to let him go, Dreketh,” Laera said softly.<br>
<br>
“Give…me…just…one good reason,” the shadow knight said through her teeth.  Every syllable set her jaw muscles taut.<br>
<br>
“I’ll give you one,” came a calm voice from across the room.<br>
<br>
The two Elf woman looked up to see a particularly large Human near the entrance.  Laera recognized him as the man she saw as she walked through the entryway.  Apparently he was the tavern’s bouncer.<br>
<br>
“Someone’s gone to get the guards,” he said, stepping forward into the common room.  “But I saw clear what was happening here, and if you ask me, he’s rightly asked for it.  So, I won’t be holding you here for the guards, ‘cause they’re not going to listen to the plea of any inkie.  You best be going, before they show.”<br>
<br>
At hearing the bouncer’s words, Dreketh turned her head to give Jaden one last threatening glare.  With an impatient shove, she released her iron grip. <br>
<br>
“You live this time,” she said, keeping her head close. “And your breath stinks worse than you do,” she added as the man gasped frantically for air.  <br>
<br>
Laera pulled urgently on her companion’s shoulder.  Giving way to the Wood Elf’s urgent promptings, Dreketh turned to pick up her sword and walk out of the tavern without further comment.<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” the druid paused to say to the bouncer, who grunted once in return.<br>
<br>
Stepping outside into daylight, Laera shaded her eyes and raced a few hurried steps in order to catch up with the Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
“You were going to kill that man!” she called, accusingly.<br>
<br>
“Where’d you learn to use a staff like that?” Dreketh shot back, as though the Wood Elf hadn’t even spoken.<br>
<br>
Glancing down to her hand, Laera realized she still held the man’s staff.<br>
<br>
“Oh no,” she groaned as she turned around with the intent of returning it.  <br>
<br>
“Don’t bother,” the Dark Elf said, grabbing hold of her companion’s arm.  “You go back now and there’ll be more trouble than you can handle, and I’ll be damned if I come to your rescue a second time.”<br>
<br>
“Rescue!”  Laera fell back into step with her companion.  “Why does everyone think they have to come to my rescue?  I’m the one who took him down!  It wasn’t until you flashed your sword that things started getting ugly!”<br>
<br>
“That’s gratitude for you,” Dreketh said, stalking around a corner.  “With partners like you, who needs Wood Elves?”<br>
<br>
“And what was with you!”  Laera was determined not to be diverted by the shadow knight's insults.  “I’ve never seen you that out of control!  Even in Kithicor!”<br>
<br>
“I wasn’t out of control, and mind your own business.”<br>
<br>
“You nearly get us both arrested, and you say it’s not my business?  I have-”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf was interrupted by Dreketh’s silencing hand.<br>
<br>
“Shh!”  The Dark Elf stopped her swift pace to glance around, listening to the sound of angry voices in the distance.  “The guards are coming.  Let’s move!”<br>
<br>
Reacting swiftly to a newfound threat, Laera broke into a dead run alongside her companion.<br>
<br>
“Your boyfriend probably told the guards you have a boat to catch,” Dreketh said acerbically as they raced down the winding alleys of South Qeynos.  “Next time, do me a favor and just keep your mouth shut about our plans.  Or at least have the decency to lie.”<br>
<br>
Laera decided not argue the issue.  This was no time for bickering.  There was plenty of time for that once they were safely aboard the ship sailing for Odus.<br>
<br>
Rounding what appeared to be a large, two-story inn, the Elves raced headlong down an alley to burst out into a courtyard filled wall-to-wall with droves of wandering people.  In every direction, the masses were buying and selling amongst each other in the bustling marketplace.  <br>
<br>
“What the… when did this crop up?” Laera asked, staring aghast at what had been an empty courtyard not an hour earlier.<br>
<br>
“Look, there!”  Dreketh grabbed her arm again – much to the Wood Elf’s discomfort – pointing to a sail towering in the distance over the city walls.  <br>
<br>
“The ship must have just docked, unloading all these people,” Laera mused.<br>
<br>
“Brilliant,” the Dark Elf said caustically.  “Let’s get moving before-“<br>
<br>
“Halt!”<br>
<br>
Whirling about, the two found that they had been discovered by one of the city guards at the other end of the alleyway.  <br>
<br>
“Innoruuk’s bane!” Dreketh cursed, shoving the Wood Elf into the crowd.  Catching sight of the guard sprinting down the alley toward her, she dove in after her companion.<br>
<br>
Having heard the guard’s yell, Laera knew they had no time to waste – they must get to the ship!  Her innate Wood Elf agility allowed her to weave her way among the crowd with a skill rarely seen in this part of the world.  Twisting around a corner, she used a tall Barbarian as a shield against being seen by the guards.  Fortunately, her small stature and tan skin allowed her to blend in among the throng.<br>
<br>
She soon reached the wooden planks of the docking pier, but her blue-skinned companion was not so lucky.  Upon hitting the dock, Laera glanced back into the marketplace to find Dreketh struggling to make her way through the masses of people.  The Dark Elf’s only saving grace was that the guards seemed to be having the same amount of trouble.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh!” she yelled.<br>
<br>
The frustrated shadow knight shot Laera an angry look.  Making little progress as she fought for every step, Dreketh waved a hand, signaling for the Wood Elf to board the ship at once.<br>
<br>
Laera felt powerless to do anything as she watched the guards close the narrowing gap between them and her companion.  The armor-laden Dark Elf didn’t have a chance to escape amid the throngs of people trying to get into the city.  Glancing around helplessly, she caught sight of the sign atop the building next to her.  Seeing the title read “Mermaid’s Lure,” an idea struck her.<br>
<br>
“Attention!” she cried, cupping her mouth with her hands.  “All new arrivals, your attention please!  The Mermaid’s Lure is giving out free ale to welcome all newcomers to Qeynos!  That’s right!  Free drinks to all new arrivals this afternoon only!“<br>
<br>
Her words were lost as the crowd reacted to the promise of avarice.  Apparently, ale was a far more popular drink than Laera had given it credit for.  She watched, amazed, as the individuals nearby suddenly switched directions.  As word spread, more and more people turned about until the crowd literally began flowing away from the city and toward the wooden building.  With satisfaction, the Wood Elf saw her companion being swept from the clutches of their pursuers and toward the docks where she stood.<br>
<br>
Turning, she ran down the now empty pier leading to the boat, labeled prominently with the name Golden Maiden on the hull.  As she approached, she noticed several men dressed in sailor garb releasing the mooring ropes as though they were preparing to leave.<br>
<br>
Leave?  That was preposterous!  They only just now unloaded their passengers!  How did they expect people heading for Odus to embark in such little time?<br>
<br>
“Wait!” she yelled, signaling to the men.  “Wait!  You can’t leave yet!”<br>
<br>
In turn, the crewmen began waving their hands, encouraging the Wood Elf to hurry if she was going to make it in time.<br>
<br>
“No!  Stop!” the Wood Elf insisted as she jumped from the pier and onto the deck of the ship.  One of the crewmen steadied her as she landed.  “You have to wait for my friend, she’s right over there!”<br>
<br>
“Look, lady, we’re on a tight schedule, all right?” the crewman said, trying to calm her down.  “The cap’n takes it out on our hides if we fall behind, so we’re leaving now with the passengers we got.”<br>
<br>
“Can’t you wait just twenty seconds?  She’s coming right now!“<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry,” said the crewman, raising a hand to signal the tiller that the moorings were stowed.  “The crow’s nest reports that the Seaking is about two or three hours behind us.  Your friend can board her, and you can meet up a couple of hours after you arrive.  It’s the best we can do.”<br>
<br>
The sailor turned to take his leave.<br>
<br>
“But you don’t understand, she-“ Laera began to argue.<br>
<br>
“Look, I’m really sorry,” the crewman said, testily.  “If it means that much to you, get off and wait with your friend.  I gotta go, I got work to do.”<br>
<br>
“If you’d just… Ooooo, I can’t stand these people!”  Laera turned to face the dock, aggravated.  Placing both hands on the railing, she searched the mob of people outside the Mermaid’s Lure for the Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
Emerging from the crowd came a glint of bronze as Dreketh elbowed her way roughly from the gathering.  Once free, her legs pumped furiously as she raced down the wooden pier.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh, hurry!” Laera called out desperately as she felt the ship moving beneath her feet.  The odd sensation that the world all around her was in motion while she and the ship remained still swept over her with vertigo.<br>
<br>
“Jump, Dreketh!  Now!” the Wood Elf yelled in a panicked voice as she extended out her hand toward her companion.<br>
<br>
Without looking back, the shadow knight leaped from the pier’s edge, her gauntleted hand reaching for Laera’s.  In midair it became apparent her bound was too short to make it on deck.  Laera extended her hand even farther, bringing her center of gravity dangerously close to the precipice.<br>
<br>
Seconds turned into minutes as the Dark Elf made her intense flight over the waters.  In midair, Dreketh’s hand met with Laera’s wrist, and vice-versa.  Crouching down as low as she could without falling overboard, the Wood Elf gripped a tight hold of her companion’s gauntlet with both hands.<br>
<br>
Yet still it was not enough.  The combined weight of the shadow knight along with the burdensome bronze armor nearly toppled the druid as she pulled with all her might.  Within moments it became clear that this was a losing battle, and Laera cried out desperately for help.<br>
<br>
“Give me your other hand!” shouted a Human voice next to her.  She opened her eyes to find the crewman at her side.  The man was reaching his arm down over the railing at the struggling Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
With their combined efforts, the two managed to assist Dreketh in clawing her way up the ship’s hull.  Once over the edge, she lay panting face down on the deck, looking very much like a beached fish dressed in armor.  Her two rescuers also sat breathing heavily on the polished wood as the docks gradually fell away in the distance.<br>
<br>
Squinting, Laera could barely make out the gleaming brass helms of the city guard as they stood on the docks, looking very much like toy soldiers in the distance.  Powerlessly, they watched as the ship departed, carrying with it their would-be prisoners.<br>
<br>
Gasping, the Dark Elf pushed wearily against the deck with the heels of her hands.  With effort, she managed to pull herself up on all fours just as a shadow passed over.  She looked up.<br>
<br>
“Permission to come aboard?” Dreketh croaked, clearing her throat.<br>
<br>
Laera turned curiously at her companion's voice.  Dreketh’s meaning escaped her until she followed the shadow knight’s gaze to look warily up into the stern and disapproving eyes of the captain of the Golden Maiden. <br>
<br>

<br>
Between the fighting and the running and the narrow escapes, the shadow knight had had quite a day.  Though she’d proven to possess the rock solid and stalwart soul that every Teir’Dal strives to perfect, at the end of the day she discovered something about herself she’d never known before.<br>
<br>
Dreketh was violently seasick.<br>
<br>
Shortly after receiving a boisterous recrimination by the captain about her conduct in boarding his vessel, the Dark Elf unloaded the contents of her stomach over the railing and into the turbulent waves below.<br>
<br>
Wincing at the hideous sounds of her retching companion, Laera Nellynwae sat with her back against the railing doing her best to do the proud shadow knight the courtesy of not making a spectacle of her infirmity.<br>
<br>
“You know, I can cure you of this,” she said, offering the help of her druid magic.<br>
<br>
Dreketh slid weakly down the railing next to Laera, her skin taking on a positively blue-green hue.<br>
<br>
“I’d rather vomit.  I told you,” she said, her voice heavy, “I don’t want anything to do with the touch of your unworthy power.  I’ll be fine.”<br>
<br>
Laera shook her head at the stubbornness of Teir’Dal blood.  Even something as simple as a curing spell to alleviate even a small portion of her discomfort was bitterly rebuked.  The Wood Elf had to wonder if all Dark Elves were like this, or if Dreketh was simply trying to prove something.  Taking in the shadow knight’s miserable appearance, she figured it had to be the latter.  An entire race of Drekeths would be too impractical.<br>
<br>
The druid idly fidgeted with her hands in her lap.<br>
<br>
“I haven’t, um-” she started out weakly.  “I haven’t had the chance to thank you for leaping to my defense back there.  After the way I treated you, I didn’t expect you to care what happened to me.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight let out a small “hmph.”<br>
<br>
Laera decided to ignore Dreketh’s usual callousness.  <br>
<br>
“Would it bother you if I asked you a question?” she asked delicately.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight placed a weary hand to her forehead, struggling to maintain control over her innards.<br>
<br>
“If I said ‘yes,’ would it make any difference?” she replied with a sigh.<br>
<br>
“Why did you decide to get involved?” Laera asked, undaunted.  “You’ve made it clear you care nothing for me or my race or my profession.  You take every opportunity to spit scathing remarks at me, you condescend, and you make every excuse to shoot down my ideas with disdain.  I mean… it’s your very religion to hate me and everything I stand for.  I don’t understand what made you jump in like that back at the tavern.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf cast Laera a look through the slits of her eyelids.  Seeing that the druid was speaking in earnest, she closed her eyes again and let her hand drop to rest in her own lap, mirroring the druid’s disposition.<br>
<br>
“The Pact clearly states-“<br>
<br>
“The Pact has nothing to do with what happened, and you know it,” the resolute druid interrupted.  “You may be honor-bound to protect my life, but the Pact says nothing about protecting my virtue.  My life was really in no danger, so I have to ask myself, ‘Why would she bother?  What made her get so worked up over some Human with groping hands in a tavern full of people?’  Can you explain that for me?  Because the Pact surely doesn't.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf curled her thin lips, puckering them together and wetting them slowly with her tongue.  <br>
<br>
“You’re a virgin,” she said with a slight tilting of her head.<br>
<br>
“And that means what to you?” Laera asked quizzically.  “As far as I can tell, the Teir’Dal place no value to abstinence.”<br>
<br>
“True,” the Dark Elf conceded, bluntly.  “If anything, the females of my kind are encouraged to procreate as soon as they are able.  It provides more followers to serve the will of Innoruuk, and it helps replace the Teir’Dal lives that are constantly lost at the hands of the light dwellers.”<br>
<br>
 The Wood Elf attended Dreketh’s words with interest.  “So, what is it?”<br>
<br>
 The shadow knight opened her mouth irritably, trying to search for words she was loath to speak.  It was apparent to the druid that she’d touched on a sensitive topic.<br>
<br>
 “It’s… not something we discuss freely with others,” the Dark Elf said hesitantly.  “Especially not light dwellers.  We get enough disdain from the light races without giving them even more cause to ridicule us and our ways.”<br>
<br>
“Well,” Laera responded with trepidation.  “We have some pretty strange habits ourselves.  How bad could it be?  I mean, we all have strange customs that other races sometimes have trouble accepting.”<br>
<br>
“You don’t understand, woodie,” Dreketh shot the Wood Elf a severe look.  “It is the most sacred ritual in the life of a Teir’Dal female when she is… ‘introduced’ to the childbearing sect.  We don’t even talk about it openly amongst ourselves.”<br>
<br>
The soft spoken druid was taken aback.  “I’m… I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to-“<br>
<br>
“No, of course you didn’t,” the Dark Elf cut off the Wood Elf’s explanation with a sneer.  “That’s what I’m talking about.  You wouldn’t even know the proper way to behave even if I did tell you about it.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s shoulders slumped against the ship’s railing.  With a squint, the Wood Elf looked up at the sun shining in the western sky as it drew near the horizon.  With all that had taken place in the past weeks, she still couldn’t seem to get past the Dark Elf’s airtight defenses.  She was quickly coming to learn that the very nature of the Teir’Dal precluded it by design.  From what she could gather, even among themselves, the Dark Elves rarely built what she would term “relationships” that weren’t founded in some sort of goal to achieve for the benefit of their race or their god.  <br>
<br>
Sneaking a peek at her afflicted companion, Laera couldn’t suppress a pang of sorrow for her.  As a Dark Elf, she would likely never know many of the joys of life – joys the druid took to heart and enjoyed to their fullest.  Simple pleasures, such as the enjoyment of the sun’s rays on her face, was a concept completely alien – even irritating – to Dreketh.  The fun-loving Wood Elf couldn’t imagine the tormented existence of day to day life in that society.  She imagined it wasn’t much different than the rigorous training she underwent during her final days in Kelethin, only to them it was a lifestyle and not just a temporary cramming session.<br>
<br>
As she watched her companion’s pained expression in fending off the seasickness, Laera decided she was going to make a concerted effort to show the Dark Elf that there were things to be enjoyed in life before it could truly be lived.  <br>
<br>
The only question was how.  Dreketh’s cynical and sarcastic repartee had a way of keeping people at bay more effectively than dragon's breath.  What Laera needed was to find a crack in the fortified wall with which the shadow knight surrounded herself.  In order to do that, she really needed to understand her companion more and discover her way of thinking.  <br>
<br>
The idea of climbing inside the head of a Teir’Dal made the Wood Elf shiver.  The malignant race did things that were abhorrent to any other civilized people.  Everything from brainwashing of their youth to outright cannibalism have been rumored to be integral parts of their society.  Laera cast herself back to her brief visit to Neriak, remembering the common-looking shops and other buildings nestled inside the cavern they called home.  She recalled how the Temple of Innoruuk appeared so ordinary – not at all like her preconceptions.  Could it have been possible her preconceptions about the people were just as exaggerated?<br>
<br>
Once again, the Wood Elf glanced over to her partner.  The truth was, she was stuck with this Dark Elf as her travelling companion – perhaps for a long time.  It could literally be months, even years, before the Pact was satisfied and they parted ways to return to their individual lives.  Until then, if Laera didn’t make some sort of reconciliation with Dreketh, it had the potential of being a very long and wearisome time span, regardless of how long it took.  The very lament Laera was according the Dark Elf could very well be applied to herself if she allowed things to continue the way they were going.<br>
<br>
“I’d… like to learn,” she heard her own voice say timidly.<br>
<br>
Dreketh turned to face the Wood Elf.  <br>
<br>
“What?” she asked quizzically.  Apparently the Dark Elf had been lost in her own thoughts.<br>
<br>
“I would like to learn the proper etiquette from you,” Laera clarified.  “If you’re willing to teach me, that is.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s blank look turned mildly suspicious.  “Why?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf swallowed.  “Well, who knows how long we’re going to be expected to stay together?  We’re not going to have many people to talk to during this time besides each other.  So, I thought if I could learn more of your ways, I wouldn’t annoy you so much.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf’s expression returned to its former blank look.  Laera cast Dreketh a sheepish glance before turning her gaze back down to her fidgeting hands in her lap.<br>
<br>
A Wood Elf asking about the social customs of the Teir’Dal?  Dreketh couldn’t believe her ears.  What could a member of an ineffectual, self-indulgent and generally carefree race hope to gain from such a thing?  A part of her said she wanted the information to gain an advantage over a race that had been a longtime blood-rival.  It would be so like a light dweller to take advantage of the Pact and try to usurp whatever useful knowledge she could take back to her superiors in Kelethin.  Though, what advantage a simple ritual of courtesy would provide the forces of Tunare was beyond the Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
When it came right down to it, in her condition, Dreketh wouldn’t have cared if Laera asked for the combination to the royal vault.  She was in no mood to argue with the Wood Elf, and sitting alone only intensified her misery.  Perhaps talking would take her mind off the perpetual listing of the ship on the ocean waters.  And as Laera pointed out, nobody else was around to volunteer in that regard.<br>
<br>
Very well, Dreketh thought to herself grimly.  If the Wood Elf wanted a taste of what it was like to be Teir’Dal, then so be it.  If nothing else, maybe it would get her to back off.<br>
<br>
“Okay,” she said softly.<br>
<br>
“Really?” Laera asked, a look of mild disbelief showing in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Sure, what harm could it do?” Dreketh said with a small shrug.  <br>
<br>
Seeing an odd mixture of eagerness and hesitation in the Wood Elf’s eyes, the shadow knight began to unfasten the heavy armor she wore.  Cautiously, Laera reached out to assist the Dark Elf by unfastening the buckles on the shoulder nearest her.<br>
<br>
“The gesture is really kind of simple,” she spoke as they both worked to divest her of her armor.  “It’s an ancient custom – well, ancient by Teir’Dal standards, at least.  It’s probably young by Elf standards.”  She busily stashed pieces of her shoulder and arm plates into the backpack lying on the deck next to her.  “Anyway, it’s an ancient and very solemn ritual swearing total confidentiality and respect to the other person’s… well… ‘confession,’ is the closest word in the common tongue.”<br>
<br>
“It’s not a sworn oath to Innoruuk, is it?”  The druid’s brow furrowed cautiously.<br>
<br>
“No, no.  Nothing like that,” Dreketh reassured.  “This is an oath any follower of any god can make, so long as it is sincere.”  The Dark Elf placed the last piece of armor into her pack.  Her task accomplished, she now wore nothing more than her ordinary red and black halter-top, aside from the uncomfortable bronze leggings she considered too bothersome to remove in her current state.  “Though, I’ve never heard of a follower of Tunare taking it.  It’s spoken in Teir’Dal.”<br>
<br>
“Okay,” the Wood Elf turned to sit cross-legged across from the Dark Elf, who did the same.  “What do I do?”<br>
<br>
“First remove your armor as I have done,” Dreketh started out.  “Wearing protective gear is normally seen as a shield to sincerity, so isn’t worn during the oath unless taken in the battlefield.”<br>
<br>
“Well…” the druid blushed self-consciously.<br>
<br>
“What?” Dreketh asked, immediately suspicious.<br>
<br>
Laera glanced around at the crew of Human men surrounding them on the deck, each dutifully going about their jobs.  Several were within earshot, so the Wood Elf leaned in to speak confidentially to her companion.<br>
<br>
“I’m not wearing anything underneath the tunic,” she whispered.  “Its lining was designed not to need anything beneath it.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh glanced down at the druid’s leather armor curiously, having never heard of such a thing before.<br>
<br>
“Oh?” she said, lacking any other words to say.<br>
<br>
Laera nodded with a half-wince across her reddening face as she leaned back to sit up straight again.<br>
<br>
“Well, it isn’t that critical, really,” the Dark Elf said, shrugging.  “What is important is that the sincerity of the heart reflects the sincerity of the words.  To break this oath means a loss of face that is nearly impossible to regain.  Many Teir’Dal have entered a self-imposed exile rather than face the shame of their transgression.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf nodded in understanding, her face gravely serious.<br>
<br>
“Okay,” Dreketh shifted slightly to settle herself better in the leggings.  “Put your hands below your shoulders like this.”  The Dark Elf crossed her forearms to place her palms against her chest, fingers together, her thumbs just below each of her collarbones.<br>
<br>
Laera imitated her companion’s example, watching the Dark Elf’s actions closely.<br>
<br>
“Does one arm have to go on top of the other?” she asked, trying her best not to make any mistakes.<br>
<br>
“It doesn’t matter,” Dreketh answered.  “What does matter is that your palms remain pressed down while you close your eyes.  Do it now.  In this position with your arms crossed and your hands in plain view, well away from any weapon, you are rendered helpless.  It’s a display of trust you make to the person who is about to place their trust in you.  If they doubt your sincerity, they have the liberty to kill you where you sit.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s eyes flared open at the Dark Elf’s words.<br>
<br>
Dreketh raised a serious eyebrow.  “That is why this ritual is never made lightly.  It is only performed under circumstances of the utmost significance, where trust is absolute.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf blinked silently as she pondered the shadow knight’s words.<br>
<br>
“Now close your eyes again,” Dreketh said calmly.  “You know you’re safe in my hands because of the Pact.  But keep in mind that under normal circumstances, if I doubted you one inch, you could very well be feeling the tip of my blade as it pierced through you.”<br>
<br>
Swallowing nervously, Laera obediently closed her eyes and imagined what it would feel like if she were doing this before anyone not already sworn to defend her life with their own.<br>
<br>
“Now repeat after me,” she heard the Dark Elf’s voice say.  “Neitsh vell ra’chan vellin sar.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s forehead wrinkled at the unfamiliar words.  “What does that mean?”<br>
<br>
“Loosely, it translates to ‘mine honor shown, thy honor served,’” Dreketh explained.  “Say it with me now.  I’ll go more slowly.”<br>
<br>
Together, Dark Elf and Wood Elf, shadow knight and druid recited the ancient words of the Teir’Dal in solemn ceremony.  Many of the sailors nearby stopped in their work to stare at them curiously.  Several of the passengers looked up from whatever occupied them, shocked at the sight of the two young women sitting across from each other in what appeared to be mutual meditation – two Elf females who reflected each other in stark contrast, both physically and spiritually.  On one side sat a Dark Elf with night blue skin and light colored hair.  On the other sat a Wood Elf with light tan skin and dark auburn hair.  <br>
<br>
The occupants aboard the Golden Maiden that day were witness to an exhibition few others in Norrath would ever see – the sight of two mortal enemies with centuries of anger, pain and blood between them coming together in a display of mutual trust.<br>
<br>
Laera whispered out the corner of her moutb.  “Now what?”<br>
<br>
“Well, I didn’t kill you,” the Dark Elf responded glibly.  “It must mean that I now trust you with my answer to your question.”<br>
<br>
“Oh no, you don’t have to-“ the Wood Elf stopped herself mid-sentence as she opened her eyes to see Dreketh’s cold azure gaze staring straight back at her.  Laera realized by her expression that the Teir’Dal was very serious about the ritual they had just performed together.<br>
<br>
“I give you now my full confidence by the Vellin Sar, Wood Elf,” the shadow knight said in a calm and measured tone.<br>
<br>
Laera’s heart pounded strongly of its own accord, and she couldn’t fathom why.  Instead, she watched and listened as the Dark Elf made her confession.  <br>
<br>
When Dreketh spoke, it was with a heavy voice.<br>
<br>
“The source of my rage in the tavern, and the reason I place so much value upon your virtue is because mine was taken from me.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once the initial shock of her words eased from the Wood Elf’s face, Dreketh proceeded to explain.<br>
<br>
“Deep in Neriak there is a place – an ale house called ‘The Maiden’s Fancy.’  On the surface, the name may sound harmless enough, and the décor inside reflects that as well.  To most people of Norrath, it would look nothing more conspicuous than any of the hundreds of other taverns dotting the landscape.  Contrary to all appearances, what lies underneath the light spirit and comfortable furnishings is something far less… agreeable.”<br>
<br>
“Along the back wall of the tavern is an unassuming wooden door, guarded by an enormous troll dressed in steel armor.  Behind this door lies a passage leading down to the basement where the ale house makes its real money.  Down below, young women are paid to entertain the male patrons.  This includes waiting tables, serving drinks and dancing provocatively on the bar top as they remove what scant clothes they’re prone to wear.”<br>
<br>
Laera, having been born and raised in the comparatively uninhibited society of Wood Elves, shook her head unknowingly.  <br>
<br>
“I’m not sure I understand.  Is that illegal in Neriak?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“No,” the Dark Elf responded.  “But it isn’t the kind of place that makes its customers popular in social circles.  Mostly because of the back rooms.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf gave Dreketh a peculiar, naïve look.<br>
<br>
“Part of what the young women get paid for involves satisfying the customer… in bed,” the Dark Elf explained.<br>
<br>
Laera blinked once slowly, her mouth closed.  “I see.”<br>
<br>
“One night, I came looking for a fellow initiate in the necromancer’s guild who had been missing for that evening’s study period.  Our tutor that day suspected that he’d been sneaking off to the Maiden's Fancy of late, and ordered me to go find him and bring him back.<br>
<br>
“It was early in my term as initiate.  I was young.  I was unprepared for what I was about to see once I entered that room.  Stunned, I simply gawked at the mature, half-naked women gyrating on the bar for the appreciation of the audience.  I stood mesmerized at what I saw, having long forgotten the reason I had come there as I stood there gaping like some fool deviant.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf paused to wipe her upper lip with the side of her index finger.<br>
<br>
“As I stood there, I must have caught the attention of one of the customers.  Apparently he thought I was an employee of the bar, because he flashed what appeared to be a handful of platinum before my eyes.  In reality it was only five coins, but until that moment I’d never seen so much money.  And here was this elder offering it to me!<br>
<br>
“I didn’t understand.  I was young.  Innocent.  I had no idea what he intended.  I reached up and foolishly took the money.  I remember being so elated.  How could I not be?  I’d just struck it rich, after all!<br>
<br>
“The man said something about there being even more money waiting in a room down the hallway he was leading me toward.  Of course, I went with him, not once stopping to question his generosity or his motives.  I had the blind ignorance to believe it was because he thought I was pretty.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh let out a self-demeaning chuckle that disappeared quickly as her normally dour nature increased tenfold.<br>
<br>
“As it turns out, I guess I was right, though I didn’t realize its portents until he closed and locked the door to the room.  Like an idiot I asked him where the money was.<br>
<br>
“’First things first,’ he said.  Without another word he began touching me and undoing my apprentice robe.  I told him to stop, but he ignored me.  By the time he had pulled my robe down off my shoulders, I became frantic.  I didn’t know what he was doing, or why.  All I knew was that I wanted him to stop and let me out of that room.  <br>
<br>
“I fought.  I pleaded for him to leave me alone, but apparently he had specific tastes,” the Dark Elf emphasized her words bitterly.  “He liked women who struggled.  In trying to waylay his efforts, I was unwittingly egging him on.<br>
<br>
“The entire time he was having his pleasure, through the fear and pain of what he was doing to me, I held those five coins balled up tightly in my fist.  Five platinum!”  Dreketh slammed her fist furiously against the railing next to her.  “Five platinum for what should have been the most important experience of my life!  I sold my virtue for five damned platinum!  <br>
<br>
Dreketh spoke as though the Wood Elf wasn’t even there.<br>
<br>
“After it was over, he got up and tossed my robe on top of me.  He made some off-handed remark as he left – I don’t remember what it was, exactly.  Once the door closed behind him, I looked down to find the sheets covered with blood.  My blood.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight paused to swallow.<br>
<br>
“Frightened, I didn’t know what to do.  So I pulled my apprentice robe back over my head and started to leave.  That’s when I saw the stack of even more money sitting on the nightstand next to the bed.  It reminded me that I still held the coins in my hand.  Glancing down, I opened my palm to look at them.  They gleamed prettily in the candlelight of the room, shiny as though they’d just been minted.  <br>
<br>
“With a sob, I threw them against the wall with all my strength, cursing a word I probably shouldn’t have been using at that age.  With a ringing clatter, the coins bounced all over the room.”  Dreketh held up her right hand palm up, slowly spreading her fingers wide.  “When I looked back down into my hand, I could see the marks the coins had made against my skin.  It even felt like they were still there!  I rubbed my palm furiously against my robe, but the marks wouldn’t go away.<br>
<br>
“I realized that no matter what I did from that point on, they would always be there....”  The Dark Elf’s words became choked up as she tried to speak.  Her brow furrowed bitterly, as she fought to compose herself.  When she continued, her words came out forced and angry.  “No matter what happened, something I had when I entered that damned room was gone forever.  Taken from me by that bastard who was out for a romp to unload his filthy loins.”<br>
<br>
The aggrieved shadow knight quickly swiped at her nose with one hand.<br>
<br>
“Later on, I found out he was an ambassador.  A high ranking official who was about to be admitted to the court as magistrate.”  Dreketh’s face turned into a pained scowl.  “I knew there was no way I would be able to find justice.  Not with him.  Not under those circumstances.  After all, I took the coins.”  She looked into her palm again, her voice sullen.<br>
<br>
“What was worse, the ritual was forfeit.  My ritual that would dedicate my seed to Innoruuk.  By its nature, the sacred rite can only be performed on a virginal female as she experiences her first encounter – normally performed by the male most closely trusted by her.  It is an intense and very emotional ceremony, and a divine rite-of-passage for young women just entering child bearing age.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf became glassy-eyed, her features ponderous.  Laera found herself wondering who Dreketh’s most closely trusted male would have been.<br>
<br>
“But there is only one first time,” the shadow knight continued grimly.  “Because of what happened in that room and on that bed, I was robbed of something that was rightfully mine.  In my life, I will never be able to perform that most divine of sacraments.  Never! ”  The emotional Dark Elf confronted Laera sitting across from her and raised her voice accusingly.  “You can’t possibly understand what that night cost me – what that meant to me!  No light dweller could!” <br>
<br>
The tender-hearted Wood Elf’s eyes misted over.  No, she couldn’t understand.  But she could plainly see the sorrow and despair it caused her companion.  She could see it in Dreketh’s eyes and hear it in the way she spoke.  At that moment, any casual feelings Laera had about the devotion of the followers of other gods vanished at witnessing the Dark Elf’s anguish.<br>
<br>
Knowing full well that any words she could say at that moment would seem paltry and insignificant to her feelings, the Wood Elf reached out her arms to take Dreketh in a comforting embrace.<br>
<br>
Her advance was halted abruptly by a cuffing motion with the back of the shadow knight’s arm.<br>
<br>
“I’m all right,” Dreketh said, rebukingly.  “Just… I’m fine.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf sat back with a hurt look.  Glancing around, she noticed that the sun had just set across the watery horizon in the distance without her noticing it.  All the crew members and passengers had long since gone below deck to the galley for the ship’s evening meal.<br>
<br>
“Well,” the Dark Elf concluded, her tone intentionally cold and purposeful.  “You asked, and there you have it.  Maybe next time I’ll entertain you with the story of how your people hacked and pummeled my mother to death while she was being held to the ground.  That will be a really tragic story for you to sap yourself over.”<br>
<br>
The seething hatred and resentment she heard in the Dark Elf’s biting voice made Laera wince as though she’d been dealt a physical blow.  Standing with fluid grace, Dreketh marched off toward the stairwell that led down into the bowels of the ship, leaving the distraught druid to her stunned bewilderment at being introduced to life as a Teir’Dal.<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 12 - The Necromancer</c><br>
<br>
Firelight from the braziers flickered around the dark and muted room, giving forth a sepulchral atmosphere.  Silence reigned while the collection of students all looked up from the floor in wonder, for their master was demonstrating their next lesson.<br>
<br>
Master Xavier’s face was lost within the shadows of his hood.  He muttered arcane words that only his most gifted pupils could decipher, and then only on a purely rudimentary level.  The spell he weaved was similar to, yet remained very much unlike anything they had learned before in their limited knowledge of necromancy.<br>
<br>
Out of the darkness of his cowl, two white eyes opened stark against the Erudite’s ebony skin.  Slowly lifting his hands outward to rise over his head, the necromancer became surrounded in a gyrating glow.  Pulsating spheres swirled about his tall figure, twisting and distorting the light until his form faded away and was completely gone from sight.<br>
<br>
The students on the floor made a variety of awe-filled sounds, greatly appreciating their teacher’s exhibition – not so much for its own merits, but for the speed in which he could cast it.<br>
<br>
“It is not meant for travel!” a booming voice shouted from behind, causing the entire room to jump in unison.  Turning about in their sitting positions on the floor, the startled gathering discovered that their instructor had played a trick on them.<br>
<br>
Having fully broken the tension, the stern master’s ebony face broke into a self-amused grin as the students gasped and muttered amongst each other in low voices. <br>
<br>
“It is meant as an escape,” the man continued in his resounding bass as he slowly sauntered his way back to his place at the head of the room.  “A temporary respite to deceive and confuse your attacker –  or!”  He whipped out an attentive index finger from within his sleeves, his voice becoming dramatically softer.  “Or… attackers.”<br>
<br>
The Erudic teacher found that dramatics were an indispensable tool that, if used properly, could retain the attention span of any collection of students for nearly any time span.  He saw himself as the main actor in an instructional play he put on for his pupils.  Not only did it provide for their entertainment, making them actually enjoy the often arduous learning process of the spell caster, but it also gave him an edge when it came to being their mentor.<br>
<br>
“Unlike the Gate spell each of you studied in the previous circle that can send you literally thousands of miles across Norrath to your home,” he continued with a flourish.  “Shadow Step will deliver you only paces away from where you stand.”<br>
<br>
“Then what good is it?” one of the students said under his breath.<br>
<br>
Freezing in mid-drama, Xavier turned his cowled head toward the dissenting pupil.<br>
<br>
“I beg your pardon?” he asked shortly, his tone tinged with annoyance at the interruption.<br>
<br>
“What good is it?” the young man repeated, this time louder for everyone to hear.  “Why not just cast the Gate spell and escape all the way?”<br>
<br>
The master necromancer slowly lowered his arms and turned to fully address his questioning student.  With deliberate calm, Xavier stepped away from his place and approached the upstart.<br>
<br>
“Stand,” he said simply, gazing down his long nose.<br>
<br>
Looking apprehensively to his neighboring peers, the student pushed against the floor and stood obediently before his teacher.<br>
<br>
“Gate yourself home, student… now.”  Again, the necromancer’s words were abrupt and left no opening for dissent.<br>
<br>
Casting a second nervous glance at the upturned faces of his colleagues, the apprentice began his casting.  Similar to the display they had just witnessed on behalf of their teacher, the young man became enveloped in a distorted play of bubbles and light.<br>
<br>
Without hesitation, the robed instructor used both hands to shove his pupil roughly back.  Concentrating on his spell, the apprentice didn’t stand a chance against his master’s cruel attack and fell backward, his arms flailing wildly.  The spell was broken amid a collection of shrieks made by the students sitting behind him.  Reaching up, they did their best to protect themselves from the apprentice’s fall.<br>
<br>
With a wry smile, the necromancer turned to take his place once again, privately reveling in the jovial laughter of his students – such a rare occurrence for so-called ‘Heretics’ studying to become practitioners of the black arts.<br>
<br>
“Gate,” he said in his dramatic bass, “is easily thwarted.  Every magic user worth his weight in compost knows how to use it, so its weaknesses are well known.  It is slow and difficult to cast.  Furthermore, I don’t care how talented you are or the number of times you’ve cast it successfully in the past , there is always the chance the corridor you summon could collapse, wasting an ungodly amount of energies, and leaving you at the mercy of the enemy.<br>
<br>
“In time, you will learn to use Shadow Step in a blink!”  The necromancer snapped his fingers.  “And the only time it will ever fail you is due to a misstep on your part.  If you are adept and attentive to the spell, it will expend far less energies and serve you better in a tight situation.”<br>
<br>
The gathered students all nodded agreeably, unanimously seeing the wisdom of their instructor’s words.<br>
<br>
The necromancer cast a brief glance to a dark corner near the entrance of the room.  “That will be all today.  Return tomorrow and be prepared for the casting.  You are dismissed.”<br>
<br>
No matter how good the performance or how talented the entertainer, once the show was over, the audience inevitably wanted to be gone.  Xavier’s classes were no exception.  Robed figures rose and herded their way to the exit like so much cattle.  A few students even had the audacity to cast the Gate spell as they left, most of which were thwarted by a mischievous shove delivered by one of their colleagues.<br>
<br>
As the apprentices made their way from Xavier’s school of necromancy, the dark-skinned master stared pointedly to the dark corner and the person he knew stood within it.<br>
<br>
“You never could fully grasp that spell, you know,” he called out once the last of his students had left.<br>
<br>
“Alteration was never my strong point,” a female voice responded from the shadows.  “But I learned enough to advance to the fourth circle… thanks to you.  I never forgot the technique you showed me, even though my instructors in Neriak called it ‘cheating.’”<br>
<br>
The Erudite’s stern gaze was set in stone as he nodded.  As far as he was concerned, there was no such thing as cheating when it came to the struggle for one’s life.  It was a point of order he consistently made again and again in his lectures.<br>
<br>
“I also remember your teaching style,” Dreketh went on to say as she stepped from the corner, her bronze armor reflecting the lambent glow of the firelight.  “I found it to be whimsical, jocular, irreverent, and wholly inappropriate to the art.  I still do.”<br>
<br>
Xavier’s aspect remained statuesque as he listened to the Dark Elf speak her recriminations.<br>
<br>
 “I’ve missed it,” Dreketh said, her lips cracking into a crooked grin.  “Somehow you always drove the lessons home where I would never forget them.”<br>
<br>
The stalwart necromancer’s stern expression broke into a wide grin, the stark whiteness of his teeth showing brilliantly between his parted lips.  What started as a deep chuckle transformed into hearty laughter as the tall man approached Dreketh, his arms spread wide. <br>
<br>
“I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me when I saw you step through the door,” Xavier said, holding his former student by the shoulders at arm’s length. “This infernal armor threw me.  I thought perhaps you had a twin you never spoke of.”<br>
<br>
Xavier raised a stern eyebrow.  Even in jest, the Erudite’s imposing height and rumbling voice could make a hardened warrior cower under his disapproving scrutiny.  Adding to that ensemble, a set of piercing eyes, which were reputed to kill kobolds at the slightest glance, the necromancer earned his share of respect from students and peers alike.<br>
<br>
“Would you mind explaining to me why a former student of mine is wearing the trappings of a warrior?” he pressed, his voice amiable yet tinged with seriousness.<br>
<br>
Pressing her lips together, Dreketh turned her head to avoid the Erudite’s probing stare. <br>
<br>
“A lot has happened…” she said as she looked over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
Xavier followed her gaze to find a leather-clad Wood Elf emerging from the shadows as well, her hands clasped before herself demurely.<br>
<br>
“I should say it has,” his deep voice intoned slowly.  The tall man’s brow furrowed in disbelief as he turned to give Dreketh an astonished look of inquiry.  He knew well that no Teir’Dal would so much as give a Wood Elf the time of day, much less associate with her.<br>
<br>
Laera raised one hand to grasp the elbow of her other arm, not entirely sure what to do.  The arcane symbols and accoutrements that graced the room all around made her sorely uncomfortable.  As a druid, she dealt in serving life in all its natural forms.  Yet here she was, surrounded on all sides by the implements of death and its unnatural mimicry of what was once alive.  The place sent shivers up her spine, and it shown plainly in her demeanor.  Her innate terror of the undead didn’t help matters, either.<br>
<br>
“Is there someplace where we can talk?” Dreketh asked pleadingly.  Glancing at the Wood Elf self-consciously, she lowered her voice to a whisper.  “I’m into something way over my head, and I really need your help.”<br>
<br>
Seeing clearly the desperation in the Dark Elf’s eyes and recognizing the remarkably unusual circumstances surrounding his former student, Xavier didn’t doubt it.<br>
<br>
“Come.  We’ll go to my dwelling where you can eat, drink and refresh yourself.”  The necromancer looked up at Laera.  “Both of you,” he said darkly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Xavier’s school of necromancy lay nestled in the putrid green mists of Toxxulia Forest, not far from the city of Paineel.  Though spell casters by nature, the tall, dark-skinned, and highly intelligent lineage of Humans known as Erudites shunned those of their race who practiced the black art of necromancy.  The practitioners of such dark and uncouth rituals were considered an embarrassment to their brethren who lived in the shining city of Erudin close by.<br>
<br>
Of course, everything was close by on the small island-continent of Odus.<br>
<br>
At the Erudite’s request, Dreketh paid him the courtesy of recounting all that had transpired as they made their short journey to his home.  She spoke about mad Kella N’Threk and his demand that she resign her standing in the necromancer’s guild to be inducted as a shadow knight.  She imparted what little she knew about the Pact of Zeranon, and explained how it was the reason she and Laera could never be far from one another.  By the time they had reached Xavier’s modest, but comfortable residence, she had already concluded her story of their journey to Erudin.<br>
<br>
Standing now in the sanctuary of his home, the necromancer remained somber and attentive throughout the Dark Elf’s lengthy recitation.  Listening with his serious mien, the Erudite stood over a small stove as he prepared a serving of hot tea for himself and his unusual guests.<br>
<br>
Dreketh sat on a small bench next to the quiet Wood Elf, who had remained silent and reserved ever since her introduction.<br>
<br>
“I managed to steal my way through Erudin without notice,” the Dark Elf explained in closing.  “It was tempting to walk into the Library as I passed it by, but I don’t know how I’d be received there.”<br>
<br>
“Probably about as well as I am,” Xavier said deeply.  Turning, the Erudite held forth a tray laden with a kettle and three cups of steaming brown liquid.  “Though I doubt they would dare challenge my right to be there, as they would you.  Drink.”<br>
<br>
“Erudian Herbal?” Dreketh asked hopefully.<br>
<br>
The necromancer smiled and nodded.  “None other.”<br>
<br>
“What’s that?” Laera whispered to her companion.<br>
<br>
“It’s an herbal tea they drink here,” Dreketh answered curtly as she lifted one of the cups from off the tray.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf craned her neck to look cautiously down into the brown liquid.  “What’s in it?” she asked with hesitation.<br>
<br>
“It is a small plant that grows only on Odus,” the towering Erudite explained with an amiable smile.  “We call it ‘Sorcha Root.’  While the stems and roots are mildly poisonous, the leaves themselves make quite a unique tea with a savory flavor.  Particularly when laced with a touch of cinnamon.”<br>
<br>
Xavier’s small dissertation on the local flora fired the druid’s interest, being somewhat interested in the subject of herb lore, herself.  Before she could open her mouth to comment, however, Dreketh spoke in a biting tone.<br>
<br>
“It’s a very valuable plant that is rarely exported off the island,“ she said, her expression disturbed.  “Your distrustful questions are insulting him and embarrassing me.”<br>
<br>
The Erudite glanced at the bothered Dark Elf briefly out the corner of his eye.  “I assure you it is quite safe, and particularly pleasing to the Wood Elf palate, miss…?”<br>
<br>
“Nellynwae,” the druid said softly as she selected a cup and took it in her delicate hand.  “Laera Nellynwae, sir.”<br>
<br>
Xavier nodded agreeably, accepting her self-introduction with a kind manner of welcome.  Laera was surprised at the necromancer’s graces.  Before her very eyes, he had transformed from a daunting and intimidating authority figure to a gracious host.<br>
<br>
“I don’t believe we have been properly introduced,” the tall man said, aiming a thinly veiled rebuke toward his former student in her breach of protocol.  He sat himself down in a chair across from the two young women as he spoke.   “I am Terrel Xavier; scholar, traveler, and instructor of the necromantic arts.”<br>
<br>
Laera swallowed before she spoke timidly.  “Druid of Tunare, and, um… participant in the Pact of Zeranon.”<br>
<br>
The Erudite’s majestic features twisted in an amiable smile, welcoming the Wood Elf into his home.  With a small grin, Laera took a sip of tea from her cup.  Her taste buds were quickly tantalized by a bittersweet flavor that was complimented by the familiar bite of cinnamon.  She’d never had anything quite like it before, and decided she could easily find it to her liking after acquiring a taste for it.<br>
<br>
“Anyway,” the Dark Elf piped in with a businesslike tone, “I was hoping the library would hold some reference to the name ‘Zeranon.’  It’s not a term anyone at Neriak is familiar with – nobody besides the priest, that is.  There’s no telling if it’s a name or an ancient phrase of some sort.  Have you come across this word in your studies, by any chance?”<br>
<br>
“I’ve not heard it before, but then the study of history is not something I have indulged in to any great lengths,” came the necromancer’s response as he sampled his own tea.  “Though I would gamble my finest totem that it is a proper noun.  There is a commonly used Human name of ‘Zertaenon’ that could very well be a derivative.  One thing is for certain – I know you to be a devout advocate of Hate, and it is plain that our Miss Nellynwae is a devout advocate of Life.  For you two to be brought together mutually by the wills of the principal gods presents a circumstance of profound import.  From what you have told me, I have no doubt something colossal is about happen, or is happening even as we speak.”<br>
<br>
“Kella N’Threk has made it clear that the future of Norrath lies in the balance of what we do together,” Dreketh spoke solemnly.  “But what purpose does our joining serve?  To what ends?  How is this serving either of our patron gods?  I think the largest question in our minds right now is, what are we expected to do?”<br>
<br>
“And why have you not been informed?”  The Erudite finished his cup and picked up the kettle from off the tray to pour himself another helping.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf pressed on to support the necromancer’s question.  “It would seem to me that if things were as dire as N’Threk implies, we should be armed with as much knowledge and instruction as we can.  What possible reason could there be in not telling us about our goal?”<br>
<br>
Not touching his newly poured tea, the Erudite sat forward, pressing the palms of his hands together before him in thought.  The dark man turned his gaze upon the Wood Elf.  “You too have reaped nothing from your masters in Kelethin, I presume?”<br>
<br>
Laera shook her head slowly.<br>
<br>
“Well then, the answer you seek is simple,” he said, addressing both of his guests.  “The answer to this question, at any rate.”<br>
<br>
Dark Elf and Wood Elf looked at each other confusedly, neither one able to divine how any part of this situation could be considered simple.<br>
<br>
Xavier stood, raising his arm in his accustomed role as teacher.  Dreketh sat back to make herself comfortable, knowing full well that the master necromancer preferred to educate by using imagery and parable over any other method.<br>
<br>
“Imagine, if you will, the one person you love and care about most in the world,” he started off.  Before the shadow knight could dispute the Erudite’s words, he held forth a silencing finger.  “And don’t give me the tired rhetoric that the Teir’Dal harbor no love.  I know the Dark Elf heart, and know fully well the devotion that can exist between them.  Do not forget who you talk to, young Dreketh.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight shut her mouth, neither conceding nor refuting the Erudite’s claim.  She knew well that while Xavier’s manner as an instructor could often be easygoing at times, he tolerated no open argument on any point of his lecture until after the lesson was concluded.  She also knew that Xavier was well aware of the unusual rapport that existed between her and her surrogate father, Xon Quexill.<br>
<br>
The necromancer turned with a theatrical flourish to the druid.  “And you as well, Miss Nellynwae.  Imagine the one person who means more to you than anything else.  A parent.  A lover.  A child.  It doesn’t matter, so long as they are the most important person that you know and care for more than any other on Norrath.”<br>
<br>
Laera pondered.  The family unit was not as closely knit among Wood Elves as one may think.  Although ties of kindred did exist, the innate wanderlust of the race typically transcended any nesting instincts they may have harbored before adolescence.  More often than not, individuals of her kind ended up turning their backs on their homesteads in lieu of adventure and exploration of the world.  This being the case, emotional ties for a Wood Elf typically involved a lover or a dear friend over parent or child.<br>
<br>
Laera thought of Rigel.  She remembered his ceaselessly kind nature and how he always put her considerations above his own.  If it meant her comfort, there was no inconvenience too great for him to make.  There were times he literally gave her the shirt off his back, just to warm her when the breeze turned chill.<br>
<br>
Dear Rigel, the druid thought to herself.  She could almost see him hunched over his desk, learning his second year’s lessons as an acolyte.  She imagined how different traveling Norrath would be, had she a companion like her dear friend to keep her company.  So many good times with him flooded her memory.<br>
<br>
“Imagine that your god has ordered you to kill him,” the necromancer’s voice intruded suddenly.  “You are commanded by direct mandate to assassinate this person to prove your loyalty.  A show of complete devotion to your god.”<br>
<br>
Both women looked up at the lecturing Erudite, their faces aghast.  Xavier nodded to himself in satisfaction.  The impact of his theatrics had, once again, hit home to his audience.<br>
<br>
“If you do not,” he chided, casting his attention between the two students, “you will have proven yourself unsuitable to the eyes of your god, and unworthy to remain His or Her follower.”<br>
<br>
Laera cast her companion an uncertain look, finding that the Dark Elf had responded similarly.  The druid returned her gaze to the necromancer, for the first time speaking in a voice that rose above a timid mutter.<br>
<br>
“That’s absurd!” she complained.  “Tunare would never ask such a thing of Her followers!  She is the Mother of All – the font of life for Norrath!  To kill anything in cold blood would be strongly against Her teachings!”<br>
<br>
The necromancer turned an icy stare to the Wood Elf.  Suddenly Laera was very sorry she’d spoken as she had.<br>
<br>
Xavier leaned down, bringing his face to loom before the Wood Elf’s.  “Don’t… be… so… sure,” he said slowly.  “Tunare knows the hearts and minds of her followers.  What does She know about your loved one that you do not?  It could very well be that with the death of your loved one, the lives of thousands more would be saved.  Do you dare second guess the perspective of a goddess such as She?”<br>
<br>
Laera blinked, losing her righteous ferver.  The necromancer stood tall once again.  <br>
<br>
“For the sake of argument, you are commanded to destroy your dearest one by holy mandate,” he said, returning to his theatrics.  Twisting about, he brought his index finger to bear on the Dreketh.  “What do you do?”<br>
<br>
Having experienced the necromancer’s melodrama in the past, the Dark Elf remained unflustered in her response.  “It’s impossible to say.  I would have to find myself in the actual situation to be able to answer.”<br>
<br>
The necromancer smiled at his former pupil’s answer.<br>
<br>
“Yes, a wise response.  Safe… but wise,” he said approvingly.  “You find yourself in a quandary of loyalties, between that of your loved one and that of your deity.  You are split down the center, for you know the soul of your closest associate to be what it is.  Yet, your god asks a great deal in the way of blind faith.”<br>
<br>
Xavier held up his perennial index finger.  “But…” he paused dramatically.  “What if you discovered that this command of your god was insincere?   What if you knew that the test was a token gesture and that He or She intended to stop you just as you made the killing blow?  What would result?”<br>
<br>
Laera thought things through before answering.  “I see.  It wouldn’t be a true test of devotion, would it?”<br>
<br>
“Precisely,” the necromancer drawled.  “Your full knowledge of the truth would taint the test of faith by de facto, therefore making ignorance pivotal in attaining success.”<br>
<br>
“So…” the Dark Elf spoke up.  “Are you saying this is some sort of test of faith to our gods?  To see if we can hold true to our beliefs while confronting each other on a daily basis?”<br>
<br>
“What I am saying,” Xavier corrected, “is that instead of being given as much information as possible, it was essential for you to know as little as possible in order to meet your goals.  I contend that either you were never meant to know the purpose of your coupling, or you were meant to discover it on your own.  Which one, I cannot say.”<br>
<br>
The young women sat next to one another on the bench, each silently lost in their own thoughts.  The necromancer marveled at how the two companions reflected each other in so many ways – equal, but opposite, both in appearance and in ways not so apparent.<br>
<br>
“Without knowing more, I will say this,” he said thoughtfully.  “The word that concerns me now is not ‘Zeranon.’  It could mean anything, and will likely be defined easily.”  The necromancer made a diminutive gesture.<br>
<br>
“Then, what troubles you?” Laera asked inquisitively.<br>
<br>
The Erudite folded his arms, one hand stroking his chin as he pondered.  “The word ‘Pact,” he said eventually.  “Pact, meaning what?  Pact with whom?  What are the portents of this Pact, and who chose to use that word?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh spoke diffidently.  “I assumed that once we discovered who or what this Zeranon is, we’d know the rest…”<br>
<br>
“What is the fifth ordinance of wisdom?” Xavier asked pointedly of his former student.<br>
<br>
Dreketh sighed, speaking from repetitious experience.  “Assumptions never lead to knowledge.  I know, I know.”<br>
<br>
The necromancer nodded, returning to his musings.  He paced slowly under the watchful eyes of the two companions, their expressions longing for answers.<br>
<br>
“Nothing more can be said until more information is revealed,” the Erudite said with finality.  He reached out to take up his traveling cloak and flung it around his shoulders.  When he spoke, it was with confidence.  “I will return with that information shortly.  In the mean time, I suggest you both remain here.  The fewer questions that arise about a Wood Elf and a Teir’Dal keeping the same company so far from their homelands, the better.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh stole a glance to her companion, finding Laera pensive and lost in thought.  Xavier tended to have that effect on people.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh,” the necromancer said commandingly.  “I would have a moment with you.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf nodded and stood to follow the Erudite to the door, leaving her companion to her thoughts.<br>
<br>
“Child,” Xavier’s voice was solemn.  “I want you to know, you made the correct decision in coming to seek the library’s knowledge.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh smiled at the praise she received from someone she greatly respected, not only as a powerful necromancer but as a truly wise man.<br>
<br>
“But I fear you allow your blood ties to cloud your judgement,” the necromancer concluded, adjusting the lapels of his cloak over his shoulders.<br>
<br>
“I… I’m not sure what you mean?” the Dark Elf asked, confused.  “If it’s the way I chose to define the meaning of the Pact, I-“<br>
<br>
“No,” the tall man said.  Without another word he jutted his chin at the Wood Elf still sitting on the bench.<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked at Laera for a moment, wondering what Xavier could be referring to.  Unable to decipher the Erudite’s meaning, she turned back to him with a questioning look.<br>
<br>
“What do you know of your companion, shadow knight?” he asked darkly.  “Do you know who she is and what she is capable of?  Have you taken the time to acquaint yourself with her?  How best does she fight?  What magics does she possess by merit of her goddess?  Who are you trusting with your life, Dreketh?  Can you answer me but one of those questions?”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf returned her gaze to the Wood Elf.  Laera remained sitting in the distance, her head downcast.<br>
<br>
“I pride you in your wisdom in coming to me,” the necromancer continued.  “But I see a foolishness in the way you deal with your new consort.  Especially if what you suspect about the Pact is true.  You may be called upon by Innoruuk to meet that person in bitter combat – perhaps to the death.  Then again, perhaps not.  Perhaps you are both to use your combined strengths to defeat an otherwise intractable foe.  Either way, I would wager you have no idea what she harbors inside or how she will react under most situations.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh swallowed, thoroughly chagrined at the Erudite’s words.  Silent, she remained motionless as she observed her unlikely companion.  In many ways, the Dark Elf was seeing Laera for the first time.  The Wood Elf looked somewhat haggard, and out of place.  She saw that the druid was tired, but not so much in a physical way as it was fatigue of the spirit.  The stress of their situation had taken its toll on the Wood Elf, and Dreketh couldn’t understand how she failed to see it before.<br>
<br>
“I advise you not let time slip away any more than it has already… shadow knight of Innoruuk.”  The necromancer pulled his travelling cloak tightly about his chest, and opened the door to embark his jaunt to Erudin.<br>
<br>
Closing the door behind him, Dreketh slipped into her own bout of dazed thoughtfulness.  How was it that, even now, the master necromancer could so adroitly point out the obvious to her – things she somehow missed?  <br>
<br>
Xavier, she thought, truly had the ability to look past the trees and still see the forest.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“Shh!  I hear it.  It’s coming.”<br>
<br>
Laera nodded in silence, at once acknowledging and obeying her companion’s words.  Her pointed ears could also detect the growling noise given off by the approaching kobold. <br>
<br>
The Wood Elf had fought many of these savage creatures during her druidic training on Faydwer.  Though intelligent enough to foster their own bizarre language, the furry, dog-like creatures were not considered to be the brightest stars in Tunare’s sky.  They grouped together in packs, often rampaging the countryside for whatever meat they could kill – be it animal, man or Elf.  Unlike gnolls, whose roots were similarly canine, these creatures held no sentient thoughts that weren’t of blood and conquest.  <br>
<br>
Laera stood crouched behind the enormous tree, gripping her ill-gotten staff tightly.  The creature’s approaching footfalls sounded heavy, so she knew it couldn’t be one of the smaller runts.  No matter.  The druid had every confidence that she and Dreketh could defeat it easily together.<br>
<br>
Laera tensed at hearing the shuffling steps grow louder, bracing herself for Dreketh’s signal to attack.  When it finally came, she rounded the trunk while swinging her staff in one swift motion.  Although the Wood Elf’s attack swung wide, the vicious arc of her staff threw the unwary kobold off its footing.<br>
<br>
The creature screamed a howling cry of warning to any of its comrades that may be nearby.  At seeing its size, Laera determined that this was likely a scout.  Chances were that it was venturing into this area to scope out anything useful the pack could scavenge.<br>
<br>
Wasting no time, the shadow knight jumped in and swung her two-handed sword in a deadly sweep that would have decapitated the kobold, had it hit its mark.  As it was, the kobold anticipated the attack and ducked below the whirling blade in time to save its own life.  On the shadow knight’s return swing, the kobold parried the blade deftly with the back of its arm.<br>
<br>
It became clear to Laera that a distraction was needed.  Closing her eyes, the druid reached inside her leather tunic to pull out a hidden spell component.  Whispered words escaped her lips as she raised her hand outward toward her target.  Immediately, the kobold’s mottled fur erupted into flames.  In a panic, the kobold yelped as it tried to douse the magical fire with its hands.<br>
<br>
Dreketh saw her chance and took it.  With a tremendous chopping motion, she buried her father’s blade into the kobold’s shoulder, resulting in another cry – this time of pain.  Placing her foot against the kobold’s furry chest, she pulled back on her blade, releasing it from the creature’s bleeding wound.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf twirled the staff about expertly, lending momentum to her weapon as she struck the creature across the face.  Seeing it stagger, she decided to press her advantage and alter her defensive position into a backhanded return swing.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the kobold’s stagger turned out to be a feint.  Sweeping below Laera’s maneuver, it made a miraculous recovery and swung its leg over the ground near her legs.  The creature’s sheer strength combined with the Wood Elf’s own ambitious momentum resulted in her being knocked off her feet to fall hard against the ground.<br>
<br>
Had the kobold been wielding a weapon, the Wood Elf would have seen the end of her fighting days.  It leaped atop her and maliciously began to go for her throat with a gleaming collection of sharp teeth.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh had been about to make a thrust with her sword in an attempt to get the creature off her companion when she heard Laera shout a single, resounding word of magic.  The kobold was immediately thrown off the sprawled druid in an explosive blast of fire.  The creature flew through the air to land on its back several feet away.  <br>
<br>
Without time to consider exactly what her partner had just done, the shadow knight bounded over to the stunned kobold.  Placing a bronze foot against the creature’s injured and bleeding shoulder, she thrust her blade down to embed the tip deep in its throat.  The kobold’s life ended with a whimper, blood welling up through its muzzle to spill onto the forest floor.<br>
<br>
Dreketh released her grip on the sword, allowing it to pin the creature’s body to the ground.  Turning, she reached up to wipe sweat from her brow with the back of her arm and discovered the druid still lying prone on the ground.<br>
<br>
“Hey… you all right?” she said, an uncommon look of concern marking her voice.  <br>
<br>
Laera swallowed and nodded.  “It had me worried for a minute there,” she said, her throat dry.<br>
<br>
“You had me worried for a minute there,” the shadow knight said, offering a hand to help the Wood Elf to her feet.  “What was that spell, anyway?”<br>
<br>
The druid reached up to take the Dark Elf’s hand.  “It’s a simple burst of fire,” she said, yanking on Dreketh’s capable arm to stand.  “Not overly impressive, but it’s never failed me when I needed it.”<br>
<br>
Laera decided to change the subject.  “So, that’s the third kobold scout we’ve butchered this afternoon.  Would you mind telling me what we’re doing out here?”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf glanced up briefly.  “Well, it’s been a while since I’ve practiced with the sword,” she said distractedly.  “I need to keep my skills honed in case we get into trouble.  I figured it’s been just as long a hiatus for you, too.  There’s that, and I wanted to see how good you are.”<br>
<br>
“How good I am?” Laera asked, unsure of the shadow knight’s meaning.<br>
<br>
“That’s right.”  The Dark Elf pulled out a water flask.  “I need to get a feel for your skills and prowess.  If things get rough, I need to know what to expect from you.  And you me, for that matter.  We can only do that if we practice together.”<br>
<br>
“Sounds reasonable,” Laera commented, searching her own provisions for some water.  “I suppose it beats staying in the Erudite’s house, staring at the walls.”<br>
<br>
The two companions sat, their backs against a large tree near the kobold’s body.  Together, the young women drank from their flasks, trying to forget the heavy green mists of the forests surrounding them.  Though not poisonous in the strictest sense, the ubiquitous cloud encompassing Toxxulia Forest made breathing markedly more difficult.  After their minor scuffles with the local kobolds, the two companions always found themselves unusually tired and panting for air.<br>
<br>
Dreketh replaced the lid on her flask, looking up into the mist high above, noting a slight loss in the ambient glow all around.<br>
<br>
“The sun must be setting,” she said.  “I wonder how long Xavier plans on being gone.”<br>
<br>
“I hadn’t noticed,” the Wood Elf responded, similarly looking about.  “So, what’s the story about you two?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh lowered her gaze to look over at the druid suspiciously.<br>
<br>
Laera continued staring up into the towering trees as she spoke.  “How is it a Dark Elf in Neriak has come to meet, and even befriend, an Erudite from Odus?  More the point, why does he seem to be the only person you treat with any amount of civility?  Respect, even?”<br>
<br>
“Hmph,” the Dark Elf said, with a slight smile.  “I suppose that’s a fair question.”<br>
<br>
The druid turned an expectant look to her companion.<br>
<br>
“Very well,” Dreketh said with a small sigh.  “If you must know, Xavier is a necromancer who works and teaches independently.  Once in a while he feels the need to journey to Neriak for the use of some of our resources he can’t find here on Odus.  As part of the arrangement with the Teir’Dal, he has agreed to instruct Dark Elf initiates in what knowledge he has to offer.  He is a grandmaster of the art, and I have yet to meet anyone who could best him.  Not even my old guild master.”<br>
<br>
“He’s certainly not what I would expect from a necromancer,” Laera commented.  Drawing her legs up, she hugged them as she listened.<br>
<br>
“To his fellow Heretics as well,” Dreketh nodded.  “His teaching style is so unorthodox, it made the denizens of the Dead begin to doubt their wisdom in asking him to contribute.  The only problem was that his technique worked extraordinarily well when it came to making the lessons stick with the students.  I can’t tell you how much he helped me during the times I struggled to grasp the techniques of Alteration.”<br>
<br>
Laera blinked curiously.  “So, what happened?”<br>
<br>
“He took me under his wing,” the Dark Elf shrugged.  “He showed me methods none of my Teir’Dal tutors would have dreamed of teaching me.  In fact, when it came time to pass my tests, I was often accused of cheating because of these tricks he’d shown me.  It caused quite a stirring among the denizens.”  Dreketh’s wry smile disappeared into a grimace.  “It seems that’s one thing I do very well is enrage my superiors.<br>
<br>
“Anyway,” she continued, “I never would have achieved the fourth circle without that man.”<br>
<br>
“Fourth circle?” the Wood Elf asked, blinking.  “What circle are you now?”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight cast her companion a hesitant look.  “Before I became a shadow knight… I was a necromancer of the sixth circle.”<br>
<br>
Laera gasped.  “Sixth!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked down and nodded, her expression solemn.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf glanced around at the noxious woodland, a look of stunned disbelief clouding her features.  From what little she knew about the various schools of pure spell casting, the sixth circle was a noteworthy achievement.<br>
<br>
“You’re not much older than I am,” she said.  “How did you achieve such a rank in so few years?”<br>
<br>
“Let’s just say I held the special affections of the guild master,” Dreketh said dryly.<br>
<br>
“Oh,” Laera’s cheeks turned slightly flush.  “I see…”<br>
<br>
“Not like that!”  Dreketh snapped.  “He’s my father!  Name of Innoruuk, is that all you Wood Elves ever think about?”<br>
<br>
“Oh!”  The light dawned on the druid’s face.  “I’m… I’m sorry.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, well,” the Dark Elf spoke sullenly, her gaze returning to the forest.  “Between my father and Xavier, I learned quickly all the ins and outs of necromancy.  Being constantly bombarded by it as I was, my learning curve was so accelerated I think I intimidated the others.  So, naturally I didn’t have a lot of… friends, really.  I think that was why Xavier treated me the way he did.”<br>
<br>
Laera lay her head on her arms as she listened to her companion.<br>
<br>
“During that time, he told me all about the great Library of Erudin and of all the knowledge kept there,” Dreketh continued.  “He made me promise that some day after I left Neriak that I’d come visit him.  Our situation seemed appropriate to the task.”<br>
<br>
“And you gave up sixth circle necromancy to become a trainee knight?  Whatever for?” Laera asked quietly, feeling rather awkward about discussing things she considered so dark and unthinkable a month ago.<br>
<br>
“For that answer, you’ll have to ask Kella N’Threk,” Dreketh replied in a dark tone.  “He insisted on it.  And I haven’t given up necromancy – not completely, anyway.  Shadow knights practice much of what makes necromancy unique among the arcane disciplines – just not in its entirety.  In time, a good portion of what was taken from me will return.”<br>
<br>
Laera nodded, understanding.  “And now you wield a sword instead of a staff.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked to her father’s sword, still impaled upon the fallen kobold several feet away.  “It’s a fair trade-off,” she said, considering the truth of her words.  “I didn’t think so at first.  But I’ve realized that in some ways I rather enjoy being able to take out my frustrations with cold steel instead of suppressing them so I can concentrate on spell casting.”<br>
<br>
Standing, the Dark Elf walked a languid pace over to the kobold’s corpse, the druid’s eyes watching her every move from behind.  Grasping the sword’s hilt, Dreketh pulled it from the body and looked at the crimson, bloodstained blade with a blank expression.  Reaching out the index finger of her other hand, she ran it slowly across the flat of the blade, catching a portion of the blood on her fingertip.<br>
<br>
“The tool of bloodshed,” she said softly.  Bringing the blood to her lips, she sampled it with a slight flick of her tongue.  <br>
<br>
“My true parents were knights too, you know,” Dreketh called to Laera over her shoulder.  “It led them to a gruesome end.  Nezzka Tolax, their guild master and my new trainer, thought it unwise to allow the daughter of his troops into a similar situation, and so asked Xon Quexill to accept me into his guild instead, as a necromancer initiate.  Not long after that, Quexill adopted me and took on the responsibilities of being my father.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf fell into a morose silence, leaving Laera to her own thoughts.  The more the Wood Elf listened to her companion talk, the more she began to understand what made the shadow knight tick inside.  The thought comforted her and alarmed her all at once.  As more time passed, the more often she had to remind herself that this was a Teir’Dal – sworn blood enemy of all Elven kind.  Yet somehow Laera was secretly beginning to form a mental rift between Dreketh and the rest of the Dark Elf race.<br>
<br>
“Okay, enough about me,” the Dark Elf said suddenly, turning about and approaching the contemplative druid.  “Stand up.  I want to get a feel for your skills with the staff.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf stood with an inquiring look.  “What do you want me to do?”<br>
<br>
“We’re going to spar,” Dreketh said, lowering her head and taking on a battle stance.  “Come at me using your weapon so I can get a feel for your opponent’s perspective.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked down at the staff lying on the ground next to where she had been sitting.  Bending over, she picked it up in her capable hand, hefting it lightly with accustomed ease.<br>
<br>
“You know you’ll defeat me in mundane combat,” she said uncertainly.  “You’re a knight.  I’m a druid.  There’s no way I can match your skills without using my magic.”<br>
<br>
“Relax,” Dreketh responded in a bothered tone.  “I’ll only use defensive maneuvers to counter your blows.  I won’t attack.”<br>
<br>
Laera glanced back down at the staff in her hand dubiously, considering how much she believed in Dreketh’s motivations with this little contest.  Shrugging, she figured if anything went awry, she could always fall back on her magic anyway.<br>
<br>
She therefore closed her eyes and calmed her mind, bringing the peace and light of Tunare into her soul.  Uttering the magical words of nature, she cast a spell to enhance her defenses.  Immediately, her soft and supple skin turned hard and rough as tree bark, helping to protect her from minor injury as they went about their practice session.<br>
<br>
Opening her eyes, she saw Dreketh’s crooked grin, the Dark Elf’s battle stance having been forsaken for an air of deliberate patience.<br>
<br>
“Don’t trust me?” the shadow knight said wryly.<br>
<br>
“Accidents happen,” Laera responded, nonchalant.  She took up her own battle stance, taking the staff firmly in the grip of both hands.  “I’d just rather not be sliced open from a wayward swipe of that blade, thank you very much.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh shook her head in a burlesque display of marvel.  “You healers are too skittish, you know that?  To my people, scars are badges of honor.”<br>
<br>
“Are you ready?” Laera asked testily.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight nodded and immediately brought up her blade to parry the nimble Wood Elf’s preemptive swing.<br>
<br>
“What I don’t understand is why you go to such great lengths to avoid even the smallest injury,” Dreketh said slowly as she went about defending herself from her companion’s lighthearted attacks.  “If a truly serious blow fell, that little spell of yours wouldn’t absorb a sixth of the damage dealt.”<br>
<br>
“There are two ways of looking at it,” Laera replied, twisting about to confront the shadow knight with a roundhouse swing.  Dreketh blocked the move with ease.  “One way is as an investment.  The more protection you lend to protecting your charges, the less energies you’ll spend in keeping them alive after they’ve been injured.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf swung low, intending to catch the shadow knight off-guard and penetrate her defenses below her knees.  Having just parried a higher attack at the other end of the druid’s staff, Dreketh chose to evade rather than block.  She quickly jumped with both feet, allowing the staff to whistle harmlessly through the air just above the ground.<br>
<br>
“That makes sense,” she conceded the Wood Elf’s point.  “What’s the other way of looking at it?”<br>
<br>
“All life is sacred,” Laera said, thrusting the center of her staff at Dreketh’s chest, hoping to catch her off balance.  “We are taught that the best way to preserve it is to give it the best possible chance of survival – even if it means a fraction of a percent.”<br>
<br>
Swinging high, the Wood Elf’s attacks became more rapid.  Swinging the staff back and forth with both hands, she brought the ends down on the knight more rapidly in a shower of strikes.  Watching the Dark Elf’s reflexes, she was impressed at the speed her opponent moved to defend herself.<br>
<br>
“The best way to do that,” she continued more slowly, the increasing impetus of her tactics causing her to become winded, “is to take them from harm’s way in the first place.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh ducked below a particularly wide swing, feeling the wind from Laera’s staff passing just above her head.  “It’s a sound battle principle.  Dodge a blow to free up your weapon, and deliver the killing thrust.”<br>
<br>
“Perhaps,” Laera began going through all her previous attacks in order, only more strident this time around.  “Except we do it to serve life, not destroy it.”<br>
<br>
“Oh really?” the Dark Elf drawled mockingly, blocking another of the Wood Elf’s swings with her blade.  “And about that kobold behind me?  Was that Ro’s fire or yours that burned it to a crisp?”<br>
<br>
“That’s different.”  Laera’s attacks became more insistent.  So much so, Dreketh had to concentrate more in order to defend herself.  “Kobolds, orcs, goblins and countless others in this world do nothing but seek out life just to kill.  If given the chance, they would slaughter everyone.  They have no respect for life.”<br>
<br>
“And you do?” Dreketh placed the sword’s blade in her other gauntleted hand, using it to block the Wood Elf’s vertical chopping attack above her head.<br>
<br>
“Of course I do!”  Using her stance to its advantage, the druid reversed her swing and brought the opposite end of the staff to meet with her opponent’s armored midriff, below the Dreketh’s raised blade.<br>
<br>
Air left the shadow knight’s lungs in a whoosh.  Dreketh brought her sword down, its blade against the ground lest she collapse from the unexpected blow.  Falling to one knee, she came to lean on her sword like a crutch.<br>
<br>
“Ugh, that was fast,” she said, wincing.  Shaking her head to clear it of the pain, she quickly regained her stance.  “So, I guess you don’t eat at all, then,” she said, returning to the battle at hand.<br>
<br>
“Oh please,” Larea said in a wearisome voice as she went through her motions.  “Don’t give me that dogma about how my own standards say I mustn’t eat meat.”<br>
<br>
“It’s not just eating meat,” the Dark Elf parried with words as well as steel.  “Every source of food results in the death or enslavement of living creatures, plant and animal alike.  It just goes to show how hypocritical your kind can be.”<br>
<br>
“Tunare put those things on Norrath to serve a purpose,” the Wood Elf’s tone became increasingly dire at the shadow knight’s insinuations.  “Killing for survival or to preserve the life of another is not a sin.  Killing indiscriminately is.”<br>
<br>
“It is that very philosophy that proves Tunare is just as flawed as Her followers-”<br>
<br>
The ring of steel echoed through the trees and the Dark Elf’s words were cut off, her hands suddenly bereft of their weapon.  In a flurry of movement, Dreketh found herself standing powerless with her back pressing against her opponent, the shaft of Laera’s staff being pulled firmly against her throat.<br>
<br>
“Take back your words, inkie,” Laera’s voice muttered threateningly in the shadow knight’s ear from behind.  Dreketh could feel the Wood Elf’s breath as she spoke, each syllable emphasized by the feel of hot wind brushing against her ear.  “How dare you lecture me in the Temple of Innoruuk about respecting your god and your beliefs.  How dare you threaten my life at the slightest indiscretion I might show toward your god.  Yet here you have the impudence to blatantly insult mine!  If you want to talk about hypocrisy, I suggest you take a long, hard look at yourself with the same scrutiny, Teir’Dal!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh was rendered helpless by the druid’s brash move.  If she could release even one hand from the staff at her throat to make a countermove and free herself, she would have.  But the Wood Elf’s ire lent ardor to the Dark Elf’s chokehold.  Dreketh was convinced that if she relented one inch, the staff would surely crush her windpipe.  Their stance was such that she lacked the leverage to throw herself forward, tossing the druid head over heels.  Even if she did have the leverage, it was all she could do to keep from being strangled by the staff.  The struggling shadow knight had no options.<br>
<br>
An unexpected blow fell painfully against the Wood Elf’s back.  Unable to see her attacker, Laera quickly tried to think of who could possibly be behind her.  The mystery was quickly resolved as the telltale cackling of a skeleton reached her ears.<br>
<br>
Immediately, she released her Dark Elf captive and twisted about in a startled panic to confront the new threat.  Just as she suspected, standing before her was the animated remains of a skeleton grinning hideously at her.  <br>
<br>
At seeing the undead creature, Laera’s heart leaped into her throat.  Her muscles seized in terror.  All through her mind, unbidden words whispered “the undead, the undead, soul stealers, soul stealers,” clouding all rational thought from the Wood Elf’s mind.  She tried desperately to make her limbs respond and attack the skeleton, but they remained obstinate.  It was like Kithicor all over again.  She remained helpless amid her insane fear of these undead atrocities.<br>
<br>
A flash of crimson steel blinked in her vision.  Dreketh had apparently recovered enough to grab her weapon and force an attack on this newfound threat.  The creature was not to be cowed, however, as it raised a sturdy forearm to block the Dark Elf’s swing.  Together, shadow knight and skeleton stood locked in a heated struggle of raw strength before the stunned druid’s eyes.<br>
<br>
“Damn it, woodie,” Dreketh said angrily, her voice strained from her exertion.  “Wake up and kill this thing before it-“<br>
<br>
Too late, the skeleton overpowered the shadow knight’s already taxed strength from her struggles with the Wood Elf.  With seemingly little effort, the creature shoved Dreketh backwards off her balance.<br>
<br>
At seeing her companion so readily thwarted, the Wood Elf’s panic rose to new heights.  Inside her head, she screamed at herself to take action.  But the steady glow of the skeleton’s eye sockets bore into her like a rapier.  This was not one of the weak and pitiable decaying skeletons she’d fought in her homeland.  This skeleton was in prime and deadly condition.  Whatever energies animated this thing sent chills down her spine, and try as she might, she couldn’t move a muscle.<br>
<br>
Raising a cold, bony white hand, the skeleton reached toward the Wood Elf.  The hideous grin looked as though it mocked her weakness.  It knew victory lay at hand – the very hand that crept slowly through the space between it and her.<br>
<br>
“Enough!” came Xavier’s booming voice from the distance.  The skeleton ceased its movements, freezing in place suddenly.<br>
<br>
Both companions remained in place as well, panting heavily – Laera standing frozen before the skeleton, and Dreketh resting in a half-crouch a short distance behind.  From the wayside of a nearby tree emerged Terrel Xavier, his hands lost in the folds of his traveling cloak.  The Erudite took his time in approaching the two.<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked apprehensively to her former instructor, fully recognizing the expression on his face.  Obviously he’d deliberately sent the skeleton after them as on object lesson.  She braced herself for the ensuing recrimination she knew was eminent.<br>
<br>
“Your ally is dead,” he said to her with a disapproving look.  “And you have no one besides yourself to blame, shadow knight.”<br>
<br>
“With all due respect, master Xavier, she-“<br>
<br>
The Erudite held up an interrupting hand.  “I saw her actions as well as I saw yours.  You and your belligerent mouth had it coming.”<br>
<br>
Fuming, the Dark Elf closed her lips tightly to heave her labored breaths through flaring nostrils.<br>
<br>
Xavier turned his attention to the Wood Elf.  “And you, my dear, have a very serious and grave weakness to overcome before you can be of any value to this partnership.”  Raising his hand, he snapped his fingers and the skeleton fell into a pile of useless bones in an instant.<br>
<br>
Laera swallowed nervously, similarly without comment.  <br>
<br>
The necromancer cast looks between the two reticent companions, sizing up their behavior.  Grunting in his deep baritone voice, he made no further remarks on the subject.  Apparently he was satisfied with their disposition for now.<br>
<br>
“Come with me,” he said calmly, turning his back.  “My labors have proven fruitful.”<br>
<br>
Casting each other glares of bitter animosity, the two companions complied and obediently followed the Erudite to his home without a word.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The thick book fell against the table top with a resounding thud.<br>
<br>
“Behold, the Almanac of Arcane History volume thirty-seven,” Xavier said grandly.  “Open it and unleash the bounteous knowledge within.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh and Laera looked at each other warily, each silently wondering if the other was going to make the first move to open the book.  All during their journey to Odus, they had thirsted for whatever morsel they could find regarding their predicament.  Now that the time finally arrived, ominous memories of the necromancer’s words in Kithicor came strongly to mind.  The mad ravings of Kella N’Threk were resurrected as well, telling omens of doom and despair for the future.  In short, both young women felt an irrational hesitation to press forward now that the moment was upon them.<br>
<br>
Sensing their trepidation, Xavier leaned down and muttered a soft encouragement in Dreketh’s ear.  “Page seven hundred forty seven.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh took a deep breath and sat on the floor near the center table.  The book rested before her, its black leather-bound surface gleaming serenely in the candlelight.  The Dark Elf received the uncanny impression that the book was mocking her somehow, as if daring her to open it and discover the truth.<br>
<br>
Dismissing such notions as being ridiculous, Dreketh reached out and quickly opened the hard cover.  Without pause, she quickly flipped through the book to arrive at the seven hundred and forty seventh page under the section heading that indicated the chronicling of prophecies throughout history as they related to necromantic magic.<br>
<br>
Dreketh began to read, her eyes perusing quickly over the spidery words on the page.  Laera sat on the bench across the table watching the Dark Elf read, preferring to gauge the reaction of her companion before looking at the words herself.  For an extended length of time Dreketh remained silent, her expression carefully neutral as her azure eyes traced long and winding paths down the page.  The anxious druid forced herself to bite her tongue, lest she blurt out asking what the book said.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf glanced momentarily at the Erudite standing over her shoulder.  Receiving nothing but a cold look in return, she turned back to the book, flipping the page.  Laera nearly burst with frustration.  Gaining no discernable clue of what Dreketh was reading, she seriously considered snatching the book away so she could read it herself.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s eyes reached the middle of the following page, and her head began to shake slowly back and forth as the passage ended.<br>
<br>
“I don’t understand,” she said blankly.  “How does this help us?’<br>
<br>
“First things first,” Xavier replied.  “I believe Miss Nellynwae here would like a to take a stab at enlightenment.”<br>
<br>
With an unusual bout of cooperation, Dreketh slid the book across the table toward the Wood Elf, who immediately twisted it around to face her.  Flipping the page back, Laera began to read as a drowning person would gasp for air.<br>
<br>
And so it was in the year 1214 of recorded Norrathian history that the Godslayer marched and made war upon the greater beings of Norrath.  Armed as he was with the Chalice, he walked freely among the planes, unchallenged as the gods fell before his might one by one.  Once unheard and hence feared, deity then knew the pain of defeat at his hand, and his hand was known by his name – Zeranon the Godslayer, bleeder of the divine, and master of the Chalice. <br>
<br>
Though mortal, Zeranon’s power became unparalleled by virtue of his command of necromancy – even to the point of cheating death of its prize.  The extents of his understanding of the black arts remain a mystery to this day, as none other has achieved the pinnacle of his choice creation: the Chalice of Zeranon.<br>
<br>
The Chalice was key.  The Chalice was focus.  The Chalice was power.  In line with the necromantic practice of tapping life’s energies, Zeranon bestowed the Chalice with the ability to harness godly energies thereof.  Once defeated, Zeranon bled his victims into the Chalice and drank of it, and therefore their power.  Blood mingled with blood.  Power mingled with power.  The power of the Godslayer grew to ascension.  Ascension turned transcendental until any one god was unable to rival his authority.<br>
<br>
Be it known that planes fell in his wake, and the nations of the divine alike crumbled beneath his heel while Norrath continued its existence in ignorance of events unfolding in the heavens.  In the end, Zeranon defied the gods openly, and defeated them in unfettered combat.  The rampage of the Godslayer remained absolute until the day of Erollisi Marr, Queen of Love and Majesty of Passion.<br>
<br>
Laera turned the page, reading on.<br>
<br>
Erollisi Marr became wise to Zeranon’s designs.  The goddess saw into Zeranon’s heart and made manifest herself to him as that which his passions were unable to resist.  The unwary necromancer fell victim to the trickery of the goddess and became unknowingly locked within Her lustful clutches, a slave to his own desires.  Once thoroughly distracted, the goddess served the Godslayer his own defeat with a single killing thrust, effectively ending his reign.<br>
<br>
What remained was the Chalice, left in the goddess’s keeping.  Though Erollisi Marr defeated the Godslayer Zeranon, She knew She remained unable to defend the Chalice from the principal gods without partaking of the blood of the Chalice Herself, and so hid it within her sacred vault and placed the vault upon mortal soil, proclaiming a prophecy from her divine lips.<br>
<br>
'The tears of the slayer upon the brow of the slain shall herald the unsealing of the Cup of Ages.  Sundered light and shadow will be cast upon mortal soil, wielded in the hand of innocence.  And the whispered convergence of power will reign unleashed upon all lands of Norrath by privilege of its keeper.’<br>
<br>
Thus spoke the mouth Erollisi Marr, Queen of Love, steward of the Cup of Ages.  Thus it will come to be.<br>
<br>
“So, Zeranon was a necromancer…” Laera mused, having finished the passage.<br>
<br>
“Not just any necromancer,” the Erudite spoke darkly.  “The word ‘prodigal’ doesn’t begin to cover it.  In his day, it was rumored that Zeranon achieved a level of necromancy yet to be discovered even in modern times.  As you see, his talents grew to empower him in challenging and defeating the lesser gods.  Once victorious, he captured drops of their blood in his Chalice, which granted him access to their power, further enhancing his abilities.  In time, victory by victory, his power grew beyond all others and he was no longer forced to confront the gods in secret.”<br>
<br>
“But, if he was so powerful, why is it nobody has heard of him?”  Laera asked, confused.  “This all took place nearly two millennia ago, but I would think that such a war of the gods would leave incredible legends behind that everyone would know about.”<br>
<br>
“Quite right,” Xavier said, nodding his head.  “However, you forget one detail.  ‘Norrath continued its existence in ignorance of events unfolding in the heavens.’  During this time, mortal kind hadn’t a clue as to what was happening in the godly realms.  I’m certain the occasional priest or cleric noticed the copious loss of their minor deities and their respective minions, but Zeranon was wise in that nobody knew who he was or how close he truly came to becoming their new master.  We don’t even know what race he was.”<br>
<br>
“That’s all well and good,” Dreketh spoke up sullenly.  “But I still don’t see how this helps us.”<br>
<br>
“You see now why I chose not to concern myself with Zeranon’s identity so much as I was concerned with the Pact itself,” the necromancer ministered.  “To say that Zeranon was powerful and dangerous would be an understatement, but it doesn’t explain the present day actions of your gods.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh rose, pressing firmly against the tabletop to stand.  With a subdued look, she folded her arms and waited for the revelation she knew her former teacher was about to make.  Xavier never proclaimed anything as being “fruitful” unless he discovered something deeply profound.<br>
<br>
The Erudite remained motionless except for his eyes, which followed the Dark Elf’s movements.  Staring into Dreketh’s expectant gaze, Xavier smiled cunningly.<br>
<br>
“I knew that the important part of the passage had been left out as soon as I saw how it mentioned nothing about the Pact,” he said, still grinning at the Dark Elf.  “Therein lies the secret that the author did not want anyone to discover.  It vexed me, as this is the only reference I could find that even mentioned Zeranon’s name.  Then I made a correlation that exposed the author’s fatal mistake,” he said winningly.<br>
<br>
Laera looked up curiously, unable to determine what the Erudite was referring to.  As far as she could see, the story the book related was fairly cut-and-dry, giving away nothing beyond the events themselves.<br>
<br>
“Therefore I present to you my posit – a theory, if you will, about events that took place after Zeranon’s death.”<br>
<br>
Hearing no objection from his audience, the necromancer began his dissertation.<br>
<br>
“It was most fortunate for the gods and mankind that it was Erollisi Marr who defeated Zeranon, ending his rampage across the planes.  I have a notion that very few others could have resisted the temptation of ingesting the contents of the Chalice, thereby usurping the collective power of the defeated gods and claiming total control over all things, including Norrath.  The very nature of the Queen of Love precluded it, albeit barely, as opposed to what would have happened had it fallen into the hands of, say… Rallos Zek.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf felt shivers running down her spine at the thought of such power in the hands of the god of war.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh looked similarly unnerved at the thought.  “But where is this fatal mistake you speak of?  What has it revealed?”<br>
<br>
“Erollisi Marr’s power is not to be underestimated, but it is not absolute,” the Erudite continued.  “It was not enough that She herself resisted the temptation to drink from the Chalice – She had to keep the prize from Her peers as well.  The planes are literally the playgrounds of the gods, so She instead locked it away and hid it here on Norrath.  It is my guess that the gods have been searching for it ever since.  More specifically, two gods in particular have been searching for it.”<br>
<br>
Laera and Dreketh exchanged glances.  Xavier grinned at them smugly.  <br>
<br>
“It was the words ‘principle gods’ that gave it away,” he said.  “There are only two gods with enough power and enough worshippers to single-handedly challenge Erollisi Marr’s claim on the Chalice.  Tunare, Mother of All… and Innoruuk, Prince of Hate.”<br>
<br>
No sound stirred the necromancer’s house aside from their breathing.  Laera sat on the bench across from the other two, pondering all that she had seen and heard.<br>
<br>
“So, you’re saying…” she began slowly, breaking the silence, “…we are supposed to find this Chalice?”<br>
<br>
Xavier turned a solemn look to the Wood Elf.  “I wish I could say for certain,” he said, his expression serious.<br>
<br>
“Wait,” Dreketh interrupted.  “What about the prophecy?  What does all that mean, about the tears of the slayer and sundered light and shadow?  None of it makes any sense!”<br>
<br>
“I don’t have all the answers, and never claimed as much,” Xavier said sternly, holding up his hands to placate the perturbed Dark Elf.  “You are asking questions clerics have asked of countless prophecies throughout the ages, child.  The short answer is that you cannot clearly decipher the meaning of the words until you have witnessed the revelation first-hand.  This usually means riding it out as time unfolds, revealing its secrets.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh forced herself to close her mouth, holding back the deluge of further questions the book’s answers had sparked.  How were they supposed to find what the gods themselves had spent centuries seeking, and failed?  Supposing they ever did find it, what do they do with it?  Why did Kella N’Threk demand she give up necromancy to become a shadow knight?  These and a myriad of other questions clouded her mind, but one question rose above all others.<br>
<br>
“Why us?” Laera asked, giving voice to the Dark Elf’s thoughts.<br>
<br>
“Why not you?” Xavier countered evenly.<br>
<br>
“Why not us?” Dreketh’s voice was tinged with disbelief that the Erudite would even ask.  “Let’s admit it – we are two very inexperienced and under-trained followers of our gods.  This task is more suited to adepts who have proven their devotion.  The only reason we’d even be considered for the Pact in the first place is because we’re…”  The Dark Elf’s eyes widened at the conclusion her own words were leading up to.  <br>
<br>
“Expendable.”  Xavier saved her the trouble of speaking it.<br>
<br>
“Name of the gods…” Laera whispered in awe struck tones.  She spoke her thoughts slowly.  “Once it becomes known who we are and what our goal is, the other gods are going to hunt us down like sheep.”  She looked up pleadingly to the Erudite.  “Aren’t they?”<br>
<br>
“They already are, child,” Xavier said, his baritone voice rumbling softly.  “Remember Kithicor Wood.  Bertoxxulous has already sent the first of His assassins to kill you both.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh cast Xavier a look of uncertainty.  Nobody else in the room noticed, so she politely allowed the Erudite to continue.<br>
<br>
“There is only one more factor that remains unanswered – the ranger who saved your lives,” he said ponderously.  Turning, he addressed the Dark Elf.  “You mentioned that he claimed his actions were done out of love?”<br>
<br>
“Or something like that,” Dreketh shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Erollisi Marr…” Xavier mused, raising an eyebrow.  “Queen of Love.  Coincidence?”<br>
<br>
Laera stared off into space, her eyes narrowing confusedly.  “How could that be?” she asked.  “If Erollisi Marr hid the Chalice from the gods, and She knows that we are out to find it, why would a follower of Hers save our lives?  Twice, even.”<br>
<br>
“He wouldn’t,” Dreketh said dismissively.  “It has to be a coincidence.”<br>
<br>
Uncharacteristically, Xavier made no comment to the brash shadow knight’s conclusion.  He merely stood and pondered, making no comment one way or the other, possibly pounding holes through both arguments in his mind to see which one held water in the end.<br>
<br>
“What matters now is where we find the answers to these questions,” the Dark Elf continued, turning an expectant look Xavier’s way.  The Erudite blinked once and shifted his eyes from their thoughtful state to look directly at his former student.<br>
<br>
“I would have thought that would be obvious,” he said calmly.  “You must consult someone who not only knows all about Zeranon and his Chalice, but who wrote the book on the subject.”<br>
<br>
Both Elves looked at each other and then down to the upturned Almanac of Arcane History.  There at the bottom of the passage on page seven hundred and forty eight was the name “Dathan Widdlethorp” scrawled in concise, ornate lettering.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="file:///storyline/storyIL.txt">Table of Contents</a><br>
<br>
<c "#FFff00">Chapter 13 - Severed Ties</c><br>
<br>
The white, towering spires of Erudin drifted off into the watery distance as the two companions stood once again above deck on the Golden Maiden.  Though looking somewhat under the weather from the incessant rocking of the ship, Dreketh retained her composure as she watched the island of Odus grow ever smaller on the horizon.  Laera, too, leaned ponderously against the railing on the ship’s tiller, staring off into the distance.  Both young women had remained thoughtful and introverted ever since they left the necromancer’s home earlier that morning.<br>
<br>
After Xavier pointed out Widdlethorp’s name in the Almanac, the question arose as to whether the mysterious author was even still alive.  Though the lengthy Almanac had been published only recently – within the last hundred years – it was composed of innumerable passages written by many thousands of authors throughout the centuries.  Unfortunately, the book made no mention of when that particular passage had been written or from where it originated.  Nevertheless, the Erudite made his point clear that even if the author was dead, perhaps other works of his could be found in his homeland.  Since the name “Widdlethorp” was a commonly used Gnomish name, it was soon agreed that the two young women should travel to Ak’Aknon – home city of the Gnomes on the continent of Faydwer.<br>
<br>
Though the young Elves could not deny the wisdom of this conclusion, neither was exactly thrilled at the prospect of traveling all the way back across Antonica.  From there, they would be required to sail the Ocean of Tears to Faydwer, and then travel through Butcherblock Mountains, brave their way through Faydark Forest, and sneak through much of the Steamfont Mountains before they finally arrived at the Gnome city – all the while avoiding bandits, wild animals, monsters, and anything else that would seek to exterminate Dreketh for her dark lineage.  Quite literally, if any two places were farthest from each other on Norrath, it was Erudin and Ak’Anon.  <br>
<br>
This was especially true for the two companions.  Although Xavier was an accomplished spell caster, as a necromancer his contacts were nonexistent when it came to wizards who could traverse such staggering distances in mere moments.  He was also quick to point out that wizards of such high standing would likely take an undue interest in knowing exactly why a Wood Elf and Dark Elf would, together, require such services.  It would be far safer to keep their actions and their whereabouts a secret – especially considering that nearly every god of Norrath was out to destroy them.<br>
<br>
But all was not without hope.  Long after the sun had set below the waters’ edge and her Dark Elf companion had gone below deck to retire for the evening, a thought occurred to Laera.  It was an inspiring thought that seemed to present the obvious solution to their traveling woes.  So obvious was it that Laera berated herself for not thinking of it earlier.<br>
<br>
Turning, she bounded down the stairs into the area below deck, searching among the crowded passengers in the common room for any sign of her blue-skinned companion.  She quickly caught sight of Dreketh lying down on one of the benches along the far wall, her head resting on her arm like a pillow while the other arm held a blanket in place on top of her.  The commotion in the room, though somewhat hushed, made the druid marvel at the Dark Elf’s ability to catch any sleep at all.<br>
<br>
Laera walked with a quick step through the crowded passengers to kneel before the slumbering shadow knight.  <br>
<br>
“Dreketh…” she whispered.  Receiving no response, she reached out a hesitant hand to shake her companion gently on the shoulder.  “Dreketh, wake up.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf’s placid features rippled slowly into a grimacing wince as she squinted her eyes open.  Blinking tiredly, she focused on Laera’s eager face hovering before her.  With a stifled groan, Dreketh wearily glanced around the room, taking note of the torches burning on the walls.  It was still night, so they couldn’t possibly have been docking yet.  <br>
<br>
She turned her attention back to the dastardly Wood Elf who so cruelly woke her.   “If this ship is not on fire, sinking, or both so help me I’m going to kick your little Elf-“<br>
<br>
“Wake up, we need to talk!” Laera interrupted, her voice breathless.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf closed her eyes, her half-asleep mind laboring to process this absurd statement.  “Talk?” she asked.  “Name of the gods, I’ve been up all day.  You can save your probing questions about my private life for tomorrow.”<br>
<br>
“Surefall!” Laera said excitedly.  Reaching out a hand, she prevented Dreketh from hiding herself deeper beneath the blanket.<br>
<br>
“What?” Dreketh responded coolly.<br>
<br>
“Surefall Glade!” Laera elaborated, her hand extended as though that explained everything.<br>
<br>
“Never heard of it,” the Dark Elf started to pull the blanket over her head again.<br>
<br>
“Will you just listen, for once?”  The irritated druid pulled Dreketh’s blanket down with a jerk.  “This will solve the problem of traveling to Freeport.”<br>
<br>
Sighing loudly, Dreketh indulged the Wood Elf in speaking her idea.<br>
<br>
“Surefall Glade is a haven for nature,” Laera began.  “All nature lovers of the west go there to rest and train… including druids.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh blinked.  “And…?”<br>
<br>
“Don’t you see?  Druids are the masters of travel!  It doesn’t take a master druid to instill us with the Spirit of the Wolf, and we could cut our traveling time in half… maybe more!  And I hear it lies just north of Qeynos!”<br>
<br>
“Spirit of the…”<br>
<br>
“Wolf,” Laera finished.  “Spirit of the Wolf.  It’s a spell that fills you with the essence of a wolf spirit, allowing you to run fast like a wolf.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked blankly at the Laera’s hurried description of the alleged spell, trying to determine if the Wood Elf was on the level or yanking her chain.<br>
<br>
“Really, I’m serious!” The Wood Elf confirmed, sensing her partner’s doubt.<br>
<br>
“You’re forgetting two things,” the Dark Elf said slowly, as though speaking to a child.  “One, there is no chance you’ll get me within a hundred yards of that place.  They’d make me into a Teir’Dal soufflé and have me served to their pet animals inside of thirty seconds.”<br>
<br>
Laera pressed her lips together and folded her arms.  “Relax, that will be handled when I tell them I’m on a mission from Yeolarn Bronzeleaf.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s expression turned to one of obvious skepticism.  She had no idea who this Bronzeleaf person was, but judging by her partner’s tone, he must be some grand leader.  <br>
<br>
“And you expect them to believe you?” she asked dubiously.<br>
<br>
“Unlike some cultures I could mention who expect deception, druids don’t lie to each other,” Laera said dryly.<br>
<br>
“Sure they don’t.”  Dreketh rubbed an eye wearily as she spoke.  “Especially the ones who hang around with Dark Elves.”<br>
<br>
“Look, I can handle it, okay?”<br>
<br>
“Which brings me to the second thing you’ve forgotten.”<br>
<br>
“And that is…?”  Laera asked rakishly.<br>
<br>
Dreketh tossed away the blanket with a jerk, resigning herself to getting no further sleep that night.  With a deliberately tiresome manner, she swung her legs off the bench to sit upright.  “I will not be touched by Tunare’s power.  I don’t care if it’s you or some other follower.”<br>
<br>
“But-“ Laera began before being interrupted.<br>
<br>
“Say what you want, woodie.  It’s not going to happen,” Dreketh growled, pulling on her bronze armor.<br>
<br>
“I was about to say,” Laera continued curtly, “that Spirit of the Wolf isn’t a spell of Tunare’s.  Shamen of the Tribunal and other gods cast it all the time.  Druids use it just because we know how.  That’s all!”<br>
<br>
“Then why don’t you cast it?  Why go to this glade of yours?”<br>
<br>
“I haven’t earned it yet.  It takes dedication and work to be granted that honor, and I haven’t because I’ve spent the last several weeks roaming around Antonica with you!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh ran a hand through her white hair as she paused to reflect on the Wood Elf’s suggestion.<br>
<br>
“Think about it,” Laera encouraged.  “We could outrun just about anything that would attack us.  Especially while making our way through the Eastern Plains.  Remember that?  It took us forever just to make it from the canyon to the river bridge.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf had to grudgingly admit that she would rather not go through that harrowing experience again.  There were things that roamed the Eastern Plains of Karana that made the shadow knight cringe whenever she thought about taking them on.  That area was more suited for seasoned travelers of Norrath, not a couple of novices fresh out of their training.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that she wasn’t looking forward to crossing Kithicor again, or the hostile Commonlands for that matter.  It was a little too close to her homeland to be comfortable.<br>
<br>
“You really think you could pull this off?” Dreketh asked, her eyes narrow.<br>
<br>
“Absolutely,” Laera replied with confidence.<br>
<br>
Dreketh grunted offhandedly as she yanked on her gauntlets, completing the ensemble of armor she wore.<br>
<br>
“You don’t think I can?” the Wood Elf asked in a challenged tone.<br>
<br>
Dreketh placed her hands heavily on her knees, taking in a deep breath through her nose as she considered her next words carefully.<br>
<br>
“I guess we’ll see,” she said evenly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The sun’s rays peeked over the rooftops of Qeynos as the Golden Maiden set its moors to the dock.  The cool morning air rippled the ship’s sails and banners gently as the passengers began making their way down the gangplank.  Among the crowd, two heavily cloaked figures huddled together, their hoods drawn.<br>
<br>
How the two companions planned to make their way through the city without being recognized by the guards was a topic of considerable debate between them.  It wasn’t every day a Teir’Dal was seen within the city walls, and Dreketh’s blue skin was sure to draw attention at some point.<br>
<br>
The recent escape of the two young women was sure to have drawn no small amount of criticism on behalf of the Qeynos guard – from leaders and citizens alike.  Their three-day respite on Odus was hardly enough time for things to have simmered down, and they decided it was best not to take any unnecessary chances.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh voiced her strong opinions about covering up in blankets and cloaks, as it was sure to draw attention to them in any case.  Laera was quick to point out the only alternative was to seek refuge with the seedier elements of Qeynos society, putting them at much greater risk and exchanging the problem of hiding from the city guard with more treacherous and far-reaching trouble.  <br>
<br>
It was either that, or she allow Laera to use her magic to camouflage the two of them.<br>
<br>
Reluctantly, the Dark Elf agreed that this was the only viable plan they could come up with in their limited amount of time – risky though it may be.  <br>
<br>
As luck would have it, fortune was on their side as they made their way among the masses past the guards posted along the docks.  The most they received were odd, scrutinizing looks that disappeared as the guards rushed off to handle a crisis somewhere involving some Dwarf named “Irontoe” at a local pub.<br>
<br>
Once out of the crowd in the marketplace, the young women weaved their way northward through the back alleyways, an area of Qeynos with which they were quickly becoming familiar.  With time and clandestine effort, they eventually reached the city gates.  As was the status quo for Qeynos, all was chaos at the entrance to the city, with the masses of people entering and leaving, making it almost too simple for the Elves to sneak through the arch and steal their way past any unfriendlies.  Dreketh glanced over her shoulder with a sneering grin at the walled city disappearing in the distance while Laera whispered a prayer of thanks to her goddess that things went smoothly – during this part of their journey, at least<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“Wait, shush!  Here comes another one.” Laera said in a warning tone.<br>
<br>
Dreketh rolled her eyes and sat impatiently across from the Wood Elf.  They had both been hiding in this soggy thicket for nearly six hours waiting for any sign of an experienced druid walking down the nearby path toward Surefall Glade.  <br>
<br>
After what seemed to Dreketh as being an eternity of sitting around wasting valuable travel time, the mid-afternoon hours arrived accompanied by a mass of storm clouds that robbed them of the sun’s warmth.  The sun’s absence wouldn’t have bothered the Dark Elf in the slightest, were it not for the drizzle of rain that later turned into a raging downpour over Qeynos Hills.<br>
<br>
The miserable Dark Elf cast a seething look of displeasure at the back of her companion’s auburn head.  The rain had caused the ground beneath her to turn into a sludge-like mud, pooling in slimy clumps amidst the brambles and roots of the thicket.  She had long ago given up her futile attempts at sheltering her head from the storm.  Instead, she chose to sit there with her arms folded, trying desperately to ignore the rivulets of water running along the tendrils of hair clinging to her face.<br>
<br>
Were it not for the potential of Laera’s idea, Dreketh would have insisted they uproot and leave long ago.  In the time it had taken them to find absolutely nobody to help them, they could have made their way well into the Karana Plains.  While it was true that they would still be wet and cold out there as well, at least they would be that much closer to Freeport.<br>
<br>
But the Dark Elf bit her tongue and said nothing of her objections to her companion.  A small part of her held out the hope that perhaps the Wood Elf could be right, and they would be able to make their journey across Antonica both quickly and in relative safety.<br>
<br>
“Blast,” Laera declared, sitting back down.  “Looks like it’s a warrior this time, or maybe a ranger.  Definitely not a druid, though.”<br>
<br>
Oh, but was it ever frustrating!  The shadow knight clenched her teeth together to keep from throttling her companion.  Everything about the druid set Dreketh’s teeth on edge, especially since taking Xavier’s advice and trying to acquaint herself more with the Wood Elf.  Try as she might, she could not believe that a druid – a druid! – had managed to get the upper hand during their spar in Toxxulia Forest.  Had that been an actual duel, she would probably be dead right now.  The Dark Elf cursed herself for not seeing that crippling maneuver coming, and vowed silently to try harder in keeping her fighting skills up to acceptable standards.  She would be damned to Innoruuk’s vengeance before allowing herself to be defeated like that again.<br>
<br>
“Are you okay?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked up to see Laera staring at her with a concerned expression.  Apparently the Dark Elf had absently allowed her inner thoughts to show on her face.<br>
<br>
“No,” she said in a monotone, her arms still folded.  “This miserable rain is going to be the death of me if we stay out here much longer.”<br>
<br>
A touch of a smile crossed Laera’s face.  She lifted her hands with the palms up and tilted her head back, reveling in the life-giving rain.  Her tan skin glistened with water running along her shoulders and down her chest to disappear beneath her armor.  Droplets fell on her tunic as well, forming into small beads that ran harmlessly down the waterproofed leather.<br>
<br>
“Mmmm, I love it,” she said.  “We never get storms like this in Kelethin.  The leaves in the trees are too dense.”  Laera opened her mouth to catch the occasional raindrop on her tongue.<br>
<br>
“It’s miserable,” Dreketh commented sullenly.<br>
<br>
“Come on, try it,” Laera cajoled.  “Nothing tastes as pure as rainwater straight from the sky!  Nothing!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh glanced up into the clouds with a raised eyebrow, her face still a scowl.  She watched as the Wood Elf caught raindrop after raindrop, swallowing what appeared to be mouthfuls of the water.  The Dark Elf soon realized how thirsty she was, and the thought of drinking stale canteen water while her companion was enjoying something fresh didn’t sit well with her.<br>
<br>
She glanced up into the clouds again, only this time without the scowl – or at least not as deep a one.  Stealing another peek at Laera, she looked around habitually to make sure nobody was going to see her in such a ridiculous position.  Discovering not a single other soul hiding with them in the thicket, she cautiously tilted her head back and opened her mouth slowly.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf winced at the rain hitting her, thinking it was impossible that so many could fall onto her face and not hit her mouth.  A few small droplets managed to wet her lips, but it was nothing she found overly impressive.<br>
<br>
“You can’t catch raindrops like that,” she heard Laera’s voice say.  “You have to open your mouth wide, like this.”<br>
<br>
Whether the Wood Elf actually demonstrated or not, Dreketh didn’t care to see.  The druid’s whimsical voice alone made the Dark Elf glower.  Nonetheless, she had already cast the first stone, and it would have appeared foolish to back out now.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh forced herself to open her mouth wider, and almost immediately a water drop landed inside, its cold temperature cooling her tongue.  Then another.  And another.  Soon, a small lake was beginning to form in the back of her throat, and she was forced to close her mouth to swallow it.  Never before had the Dark Elf tasted water that was so refreshing!  The only water she had ever known was from the underground river that ran through Neriak.  Until that moment, she had mistakenly assumed all water tasted that way.  <br>
<br>
Thunder rolled along the hillside and the smallest of chuckles escaped the Dark Elf’s lips as she opened her mouth again for a refill.  At hearing the Dark Elf make a noise, Laera brought her head back down to watch her companion undergo this new experience.<br>
<br>
“Did I tell you?” she said winningly.  “You’ll never get a taste like this out of a pod or waterskin, I can promise you that!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh swallowed a second time, bringing her own face down to speak as well.  Her expression was twisted into a grimace.  “Ugh!  I hate water on my face, though.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, me too,” Laera answered, tilting her head back again, her mouth open wide.  “Buh yah ged yuth do id.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh responded in kind for a third helping when she suddenly yelped and jerked her head back down.  Larea jumped at the Dark Elf’s startled scream , immediately looking over to see what happened.  She found her companion sitting there with a pained look, a hand covering both mouth and nose.  <br>
<br>
“What!  What is it?” she asked, concerned.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf stifled a groan.  “Name of the gods, a drop went up my nose,” she said.<br>
<br>
Laera’s look of concern transformed gradually into one of amusement.  Her shoulders shook as she tried to cover the smile she wore at her companion’s expense.<br>
<br>
“It isn’t funny!” Dreketh shot back with an angry glare.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf was about to make a kind-hearted apology when a voice called out in the distance.<br>
<br>
“Halt!  Stay where you are!”<br>
<br>
Their stormy repast immediately forgotten, the two Elves turned immediately to look in the direction the voice came from.  The flashing lightning revealed one of the patrolling guards approaching a stunned-looking Human near the entrance to Surefall.<br>
<br>
“Thank Tunare!” Laera whispered fervently.  “For a moment I thought we were dead.”<br>
<br>
Receiving no reply from her companion, she looked over her shoulder to find Dreketh’s usual dark and cynical expression had returned.  The Dark Elf continued watching with grim interest as the guard outside went about his duties.  Oh well, the Wood Elf thought to herself.  So much for fun.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s hand hit Laera squarely in the back, interrupting her thoughts.  <br>
<br>
“Look over there,” The Dark Elf said in an urgent tone.<br>
<br>
Turning back around, Laera caught sight of another figure approaching Surefall Glade, dressed all in leather.  He walked amidst the storm with a casual manner – if the rain bothered him at all, he gave no indication.  The man looked to be outwardly Human, but possessed the sharp features of an Elf.  Laera figured he was probably Half-Elven.<br>
<br>
What captured the druid’s attention the most was the large staff the man carried.  It was made of a dark wood, curving into a crook at the top end.  If she looked closely, she imagined that she could see a slight aura surrounding the staff.  Laera would have bet good money that it was one of those Glowing Wooden Crooks she had heard so much about in school.  Druids loved them, and they grabbed them up whenever they got the chance.  Furthermore, it was an item only seasoned druids were likely to acquire, meaning he would likely possess the Spirit of the Wolf spell they needed, if not a full teleportation spell.<br>
<br>
“He’s got to be a druid,” Laera whispered excitedly.  “I think we may have just found our ticket to Freeport.  If we’re very lucky, maybe even somewhere on Faydwer!”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf whirled around to address the Dark Elf.  She was surprised to see how Dreketh could retain her composure after lying in wait so long to finally discover their quarry.  Instead of enthusiasm, the shadow knight stared at the unwary Half-Elf with an odd expression, not unlike a lion about to pounce on its prey.<br>
<br>
“Now let me handle this,” Larea spoke calmingly.  “Stay here and I’ll go out and talk to him.”<br>
<br>
“Hurry,” was all the Dark Elf said in response, still eyeing the man outside.<br>
<br>
Casting one more cautious look to her companion, the Wood Elf shuffled into a crouch.  As the Half-Elf approached the nearest spot in the road, she stepped out and ran down the hillside to meet up with him.<br>
<br>
“Hail!” Laera called out, coming to stand before the man.<br>
<br>
The Half-Elf looked in the direction of her voice.  Seeing the caducean symbol embroidered on Laera’s tunic as she approached, he recognized her as a fellow druid.<br>
<br>
“Hail yourself, friend!” he said amiably, raising a hand in greeting.<br>
<br>
Laera took a moment to catch her breath from the sprint she made down the hill.  Up close, she noticed that not only was the Half-Elf a druid, but a strikingly handsome one at that.  His kind eyes looked at her with such chivalry, she thought her heart might skip a beat or two.<br>
<br>
“Thanks… for stopping,” she said with a gasp.  “I am in need of your help, brother…?”<br>
<br>
“Veran,” he said, introducing himself with a quick bow and a smile.  “I am on my way to Surefall to celebrate a victory I just had in the Karanas.  Why don’t you come and join me, sister?  You can tell me what you need, and I’ll even buy you a drink.”<br>
<br>
“No, no,” Laera replied, shaking her head.  “I’m afraid I don’t have time for that right now.  It’s vitally important that my companion and I get to Faydwer right away.”<br>
<br>
“Companion…?” Veran looked about, confused.<br>
<br>
“Oh, she’s up in the brush keeping watch,” Laera said, waving a hand back the direction she came.  “But we desperately need to get to Faydwer.  I’m on a mission from Yeolarn Bronzeleaf.”<br>
<br>
Recognizing the esteemed high priest’s name, the Half-Elf lost his composure.  “Bronzeleaf?  Of Felwithe?”<br>
<br>
Laera nodded.<br>
<br>
“Well, certainly!” he said animatedly.  “Tunare be praised!  Anything I can do for you, sister.  My good fortune today is your good fortune.  Just be sure to mention my name when you arrive in Felwithe, right?”<br>
<br>
“Sure, yeah,” Laera agreed, eager to return to the thicket and be on her way.  “I’ll be sure to mention your kindness.  Come, I’ll take you to our camp.”<br>
<br>
Turning, the Wood Elf raced back up the hill, the Half-Elf in tow.  Though her pace was not as furious as when she raced down the hillside, the journey back up was even more debilitating.  Gasping for breath, Laera leaned over, her hands resting on her knees for support as she spoke.<br>
<br>
“Okay, now I have to warn you, my friend is-“ Laera’s sentence was cut short as she looked up to find the Half-Elf in the clutches of Dreketh’s bronze arm, the blade of her sword held firmly against his throat.<br>
<br>
“What’s going on here?” he said grimly, looking at the Wood Elf from within the shadow knight’s strong-armed embrace.  “Who are you that you would do this, for you are no druid!”<br>
<br>
“Dreketh, what in Tunare’s name are you doing!” Laera called out to her companion.<br>
<br>
“Don’t ever use that name in conjunction with mine, woodie,” Dreketh muttered.  “I’m about to give you a lesson in how to get things done.”<br>
<br>
The Half-Elf’s nostrils flared with indignity.  Without seeing his attacker, he had no way of telling if she was truly a threat, or some whelp that happened to get the drop on him.  He glared his malevolence at the Wood Elf who obviously paraded around as a druid in order to lure trusting people into this vile trap.<br>
<br>
“Now listen up, half-breed,” Dreketh spoke into his ear.  “You will take us all immediately to Faydwer as close to the city of Ak’Anon as you possibly can.  One small hint that the spell you’re casting isn’t one of teleportation, and you’ll be wearing a new neck size at your own funeral.  Understood?”<br>
<br>
“Teir’Dal filth!” Veran spat, recognizing Dreketh’s accent.  “I just finished slaughtering two of your kind in the Karanas, I can handle you!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh pressed her blade against the veins in his neck more insistently.  “Don’t be too sure,” she whispered.  Her voice took on a coolly dangerous tone that grew more violent as she spoke.  “One jerk on your part and my blade will end your days on Norrath.  And if that doesn’t finish you off, the Touch will, so don’t mess with me!”<br>
<br>
“Dreketh, stop it!” Laera yelled over the thunder of the storm.  “I had his full cooperation until you jumped in and-“<br>
<br>
“He would have killed me on the spot once he saw my skin!” Dreketh shouted back, the rain hitting her in torrents as the wind picked up in its fury.  “If you don’t know that, then you’re even more naïve than I gave you credit for!  The only way a Teir’Dal can get anything in this world is through force!  Isn’t that right, half-breed!”<br>
<br>
Veran merely gritted his teeth, glaring bitterly at the only person he could see – Laera.  The Wood Elf returned his gaze with a pleading look, silently trying to convince him that she hadn’t intended to lead him into a trap.  But the Half-Elf’s anger was beyond reason.<br>
<br>
As the rain fell in a flood from the lightning-filled sky, Laera approached her companion with soft steps.  “Please, Dreketh.  Just let him go and we’ll get out of here and pretend this didn’t happen.  Please don’t hurt him, Dreketh.  I’m begging you.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf’s stone cold features froze, save for the water running down her face.<br>
<br>
“Cast the spell, half-breed, or you die now,” she said, her eyes fixed on the pleading Wood Elf before her.<br>
<br>
“No, Veran, don’t!” Laera’s expression lost all hint of pleading and turned to a one of dire threat.  “Dreketh, you so much as scratch him and I swear I’ll make you regret it!  I was the one who brought him here and I refuse to have his blood on my hands!  I won’t allow it!”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight’s expression remained ominously unchanged.<br>
<br>
Laera reached over her shoulder and retrieved her staff.  Taking on an aggressive stance, she spoke again over the wind and thunder.  “My oath to Tunare, shadow knight.  Kill him and I’ll send you straight to your Master before you can beg for your life!”<br>
<br>
“Save your idle threats, woodie,” Dreketh called back.  “I know you!  You wouldn’t do that even if you were able!  The Pact forbids-”<br>
<br>
“The Pact won’t mean spit to me, inkie!” Laera screamed back.  “I’ll tell you one last time, I won’t have this man’s blood on my hands!  Let…him…go!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s cool features turned furious.  Hearing the ardor in Laera’s voice, she could detect no sign of deception.  The wind picked up into a gale force, causing her hair to whip about her head violently, as did Laera’s.  Lightning began to flare every few seconds, as though the gods themselves were battling over the power struggle that took place below.<br>
<br>
“I let him go now and he’ll kill me!” she shouted over nature’s fury.<br>
<br>
Seeing the expression on Veran’s face, Laera didn’t doubt it.  More likely, he was about to kill them both once he was released.  In truth, he had every right to.<br>
<br>
“Please, Veran,” she called out to him.  “This has all been a terrible mistake!”<br>
<br>
“Tell it to Tunare, treacherous Elf!” he shouted back.  <br>
<br>
At that moment a cry went out in the distance.  Someone traveling along the road had seen the altercation and was running up the hill.<br>
<br>
“Look out!” Laera called, pointing behind the Dark Elf and her captive.<br>
<br>
Heeding the call of danger, Dreketh released the Touch into Veran.  The violent shockwave hit the Half-Elf fully in the chest where her arm crossed it, causing its power to arc straight through his internal organs to the spot where her torso met his back.  The Touch reverberated through his quivering body, dimming his senses with searing pain.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight released the Half-Elf with a brutal shove, pitching the man forward into the sodden ground.  Twisting about, she prepared herself to meet the newfound threat approaching from behind.  Laera immediately ran to Veran’s aid as he blearily struggled to regain his footing.<br>
<br>
“Please, Veran.  Just run.  Go!” she said pleadingly.  In the distance she could hear Dreketh’s blade meet with steel.  “I’m begging you!  Please just forget this ever happened!”<br>
<br>
But the Half-Elf’s anger was not to be swayed.  His bewildered eyes glared at Laera’s face with such animosity that it became clear he had no intention of letting either of them off the hook.<br>
<br>
Lightning flared, followed by an immediate crash of thunder as Laera realized what she must do.  Breathing heavily, the Wood Elf hesitated a moment to whisper a prayer of repentance before bringing her staff down on the back of the man’s skull.  With a wheezing groan, he was rendered unconscious.<br>
<br>
Watching the dazed and defenseless druid crumple under her vicious blow, Laera gasped. <br>
<br>
“What have I done…?” she whispered.  “Sweet Tunare, what have I done?”<br>
<br>
What she had done was turned against and even assaulted a fellow defender of nature.  All good intentions aside, in the end she attacked this dazed and defenseless man.  She was a traitor.  To make matters worse, he was rendered as such by her ineptitude – her own misjudgment.  <br>
<br>
The sound of clashing metal caught the druid’s attention once again.  She looked up through the rain to see Dreketh battling some Human warrior several paces away.  Though they looked to be equally matched when it came to fighting skill, Dreketh’s superior weapon and armor soon won out.   As the shadow knight deftly parried a blow, she whirled about to thrust her weapon backwards beneath her arm.  The blade struck home, its tip piercing cleanly through the Human’s unprotected abdomen.<br>
<br>
“No!” Laera cried out over the roaring thunder.  Standing, she ran to the Dark Elf just in time to see the shadow knight pull her sword loose.  The Human fell to the ground in a lifeless heap, a dark stain of blood welling on the ground below.<br>
<br>
White as a sheet, the Wood Elf skidded to a halt in the mud.  “You killed him!” she shouted.  “He was just a bystander!”<br>
<br>
“He threatened my life, so I ended his,” Dreketh said darkly, the storm’s thunder accentuating her words.  “Let’s move.  If we’re lucky we can make the Karanas by midnight.  There’s nothing more to be done here.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf turned, heading East toward the plains, expecting the usually reticent Wood Elf to follow.<br>
<br>
“Hate’s mercy there isn’t,” Laera muttered.  Raising her hand outward, she spoke several words of power.<br>
<br>
Vines from the earth grew forth amid the watery mud and began to entangle themselves among the shadow knight’s feet.  With a slithering motion, the magical plant began creeping up her armor-clad ankles to her calves, and then snaking further upward to surround her thighs.<br>
<br>
“What the-?” Dreketh halted, looking down to her legs in confusion.  The vine’s tentacles clung together loosely, slowing her steps to a near crawl as she fought to move.<br>
<br>
“You have desecrated the Pact, Teir’Dal!” Laera shouted, her fury matching the storm.  Her hair flew out of control as she addressed the ensnared Dark Elf.  “Tunare called me on this holy quest on Her behalf.  Now, because of your deception, I have betrayed that trust!”<br>
<br>
“Release me, woodie!” the Dark Elf demanded.  “Your god intends to see the Pact completed as much as mine!”<br>
<br>
“Is this what Tunare intended?” Laera gestured to the unconscious Half-Elf nearby.  “This should not have happened!  None of it!”  The Wood Elf pointed an accusing finger at the lifeless body near Dreketh’s feet.  “And this… this is cold-blooded murder!  This wasn’t some bloodthirsty gnoll or orc!  He was Human – one of Tunare’s children!  He had no chance of defeating you, and you slaughtered him anyway!  Is this what the Pact means to you?”<br>
<br>
“This foolish Human was dead the moment he took his sword to me!” Dreketh shouted back.  “I will fight whomever I must fight to fulfill the wishes of my god!  I will kill whomever I must kill to survive in doing so!  The circumstances are irrelevant!  I will see His will done!  If you don’t like it, then next time I suggest you turn your back, because his blood will not be the last to stain my sword!”<br>
<br>
Laera looked aghast at the Dark Elf, seeing her, perhaps, for the first time.  She had always known Dreketh was a true-blooded Teir’Dal through and through – she reminded herself of this fact whenever she started feeling any sort of kinship to her partner.  But her mind could not accept that this was the same person who had shown her the ritual of the vellin sar.  She could not believe that this was the same person who, scant moments ago, had been enjoying something as innocent as catching rain with her tongue, not unlike any child.<br>
<br>
Such were the Teir’Dal, she told herself coldly.  This time, Laera firmly resolved never to forget it.<br>
<br>
“I’ll not be a party to murder!  As far as I’m concerned, the Pact of Zeranon is over!” she shouted, followed by a particularly loud thunderclap.  “I leave you to your hideous life and your twisted race, Dark Elf!  I’ll have nothing more to do with you and your ways!  I hope you spend eternity with your Master, wallowing in the sea of His hatred!  It will be half what you deserve!”<br>
<br>
With a flourish, the Wood Elf began using her magic.  Dreketh recognized it as a Gate spell that would transport the druid to points unknown.  Most likely it would take her back to her homeland, but the Dark Elf couldn’t be certain.  All she knew for sure was that the insane druid must be stopped, whatever the cost.<br>
<br>
“Wood Elf!” she shouted as Laera became surrounded by swirling bubbles of light.  “You leave now and I’ll not accept responsibility for breaking the Pact!  The sin will be on your shoulders, druid!  You hear me?  Not mine – yours!”<br>
<br>
Struggling as best she could against the Wood Elf’s tangling bonds, Dreketh tried with all her might to make her way to where the druid stood casting.  Perhaps she could make it there in time to distract her from the spell, as they had seen demonstrated in Xavier’s school.  Reaching out, she stretched forth to make a desperate grab for her partner when suddenly her hand became silhouetted by a clear white flash.  Laera’s spell had come to completion.  The blinding light cleared almost instantly, and Dreketh could see no sign of the Wood Elf’s form among the diminishing orbs.<br>
<br>
The advocate of Tunare was gone.  The Pact of Zeranon was broken.<br>
<br>
Dreketh balled her hands into fists, raising her face to the storm clouds above in an imitation of her earlier actions – only this time her mouth was opened wide in an impotent cry of fury.  The Dark Elf had gone beyond rage.  She had sacrificed everything for the infernal Pact of Zeranon.  She sacrificed her gift of necromancy and the life she lived with her father in Neriak.  But most painful of all, she sacrificed her people.  Dreketh stood alone and abandoned in a hostile land with no place to call home, all because of one simple spell cast by her partner  -- a spell she herself had sacrificed the power to use in becoming a shadow knight.<br>
<br>
“Damn you, Wood Elf!  Damn your treachery!” Dreketh’s voice rang out in a clear and perfect harmony with the incessant thunder resounding among the hills.  “I will see you dead on the end of my blade!  I will taste your blood as it drips from my hands!  By Innoruuk’s name, I so swear it!  I swear it!”<br>
<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 14 - The Enchantress</c><br>
<br>
Shalyndrial sat, watching the surf come in as the day waned.  This was by far her most favorite part of being alive; watching the sunset across ocean waters stretching off into infinity.  Such peace and tranquility could not be captured by the hand of any artist.   The mere thought made the High Elf chuckle softly to herself as she sat in awe of the deep reds and oranges streaking across the sky.  The billowing clouds hung low over the sea, defying the laws of gravity as though it were no greater a feat than defying the paltry laws of mortal man.  Truly it was a spectacle to behold, held in reverence to those who took the time to appreciate it.<br>
<br>
The soft-spoken enchantress not only took the time to appreciate these moments, but she savored them like the finest cuisine of the gods.  Her eyes feasted on Norrath’s beauty every chance she got, realizing that no matter how many sunsets she watched, each one held a unique beauty that would never be seen again except in her flawless memory.<br>
<br>
The High Elf took in a deep breath, the sweet scent of the sea air filling her nostrils.  Closing her eyes, she listened to the waves lapping against the shore below.  Her feet dangled over the edge of the wooden dock, swirling their naked way through the ripping waters of the high tide.  The sensation was like the caress of a long time lover who knew every inch of her body, where to touch and how to give her the greatest pleasure.  Though numerous lovers had graced her bed in the years of her life, none filled her with so much satisfaction than the firm, but gentle hand of Norrath itself.<br>
<br>
Raising a hand to cradle her albino face, Shalyndrial pretended that it was the hand of the world seducing her with its gentle touch.  It was a silly and foolish fantasy of hers, but it was one she enjoyed.<br>
<br>
The fanciful High Elf was prone to such indulgences – she didn’t care who saw her.  As far as she was concerned, most other people were too wrapped up in their petty concerns to appreciate the true ecstasies life in Norrath had to offer, if only they would let it.  So what if they thought she appeared foolish?  It only served to prove how sad and empty their lives really were.<br>
<br>
Day to day life was no excuse.  As an enchantress, she found that the demands made on a spell caster were often excruciating, with many expectations to live up to.  Of necessity, all the arcane disciplines were strict, leading most of its constituents toward dourness.  It was expected.  Shalyndrial rejected that option, however, and strove to retain the gentle and kindhearted nature with which she was born.<br>
<br>
She was fortunate, as her gift of perfect recollection afforded her this luxury.   While her peers poured over their research time after time to commit the complex spells to memory, Shalyndrial would read something only once and it would be hers instantly and forever.  It was a source of angst for her colleagues, certainly, but the ceaselessly sweet nature of the gifted High Elf made any open displays of bitterness a rarity.<br>
<br>
Her perfect memory also provided the High Elf with a means of preserving unique experiences such as the sunset before her.  From that point on, all Shalyndrial must do was close her eyes, and she could relive the experience in perfect detail again and again.  <br>
<br>
Out of the burning redness of the dipping sun emerged the dark outline of a seafaring vessel on its approach to port, arriving to deliver the latest batch of Faydwer’s visitors and immigrants from Antonica.  The High Elf watched the sails as they caught the breath of Norrath’s wind, propelling the ship toward its destination.  <br>
<br>
Shalyndrial marveled at it, thinking how so rarely did technology portray such an intimate coupling with nature in order to go about its task.  Typically, it was the tendency of machinery to go against nature’s grain. Reshaping it.  Transcending it.  Defying it.  But every time she watched a sea vessel unfurl its mighty sails, she marveled at the stylish and subtle means of traveling the seas – graceful in its clever elegance.<br>
<br>
Ever closer the ship approached, the High Elf watching it grow in size with each tranquil moment that passed.  Sitting there observing the languid motions of the vessel amongst the waves, Shalyndrial admitted to herself that it was little wonder such ships were given names.  Somehow, without merit of magic or any mystical power, these inanimate creations of man seemed to take on personalities all their own.  She could almost feel the approaching ship’s palpable awareness, as it made it’s winsome way through the rippling waters toward her.<br>
<br>
“If she could speak, what stories would she tell?” Shalyndrial asked herself in wonder.<br>
<br>
Larger and larger the ship grew until finally its masts towered over the tiny High Elf sitting on the docks, its flags waving in the breeze.  Shalyndrial discovered the vessel’s personality became even more pronounced up close, as she could see it in sharp detail.  The polished wood of the hull swirled in graceful arcs, identifying it uniquely in much the same way as a person’s fingerprint.  The finery of the ship’s craftsmanship gave the vessel an ornate sense of character as the sailors went about caring for it as they would a loved one.<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial smiled at her overdeveloped sense romanticism.<br>
<br>
The boat came to a precarious halt at the end of the pier; it’s motions only slight in the meager waves near the shore.  The sailors’ voices broke the silence as they made ready the moors and gangplank in their docking procedures.<br>
<br>
Before long, the passengers began disembarking, and the High Elf sat placidly watching each individual’s reaction to their arrival.  She picked out those whom she could tell were seasoned travelers, blandly accustomed to seeing the usual sights one can find in every seaport.  Others looked about themselves in wonder, obviously having never visited the continent before in their lives.<br>
<br>
Simply sitting back and observing the actions of others was a pastime that never wore thin on Shalyndrial.  She found it delightfully amusing how people behaved when they didn’t realize they were being watched.  Even though all the individuals she watched were uniquely different in their own manner, the High Elf did start to notice the emergence of some generalizations that could be made.  For instance, High Elves and Erudites typically kept to themselves silently, while the Dwarves and Halfling folk tended to talk more.  The many other races possessed their own usual habits, but the Humans delivered the most varied reactions she had ever seen.  Some were marveling while others remained indifferent.  Most were any number of steps in between.  Some were smiling and happily talking to whomever would listen, while others…<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial tilted her head curiously.  Now that was odd.  Normally, Wood Elves donned a cheerful demeanor, particularly when arriving at their homeland after a long trip at sea.  It was very unseemly to observe one returning to Faydwer from Antonica with a dull, somber expression.  The High Elf had seen many of her Wood Elf cousins in her time.  She had seen happy ones, sad ones, timid ones, and even the occasional hot-tempered ones.  But never before had she seen one with an expression quite like this young woman.<br>
<br>
As the Wood Elf in question approached along the pier, the enchantress discovered that this person was not only somber, but she was making a valiant effort to hold back a deluge of tears behind those green eyes.  It became increasingly obvious to the High Elf with every small step this young woman took that something was dreadfully wrong.<br>
<br>
With a splash of water, Shalyndrial pulled her delicate white feet out of the waves below and rose to stand barefoot on the wooden dock.  Concern shadowed her refined features as she stepped lightly along the wooden planks toward the distressed girl.<br>
<br>
“Pardon me,” the High Elf spoke with a musical voice as she reached out to gently waylay the Wood Elf.  “I’m terribly sorry to bother you, miss.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf stopped to look up, her thin lips not muttering a word.<br>
<br>
“I’m afraid I am unfamiliar with the routes,” Shalyndrial said, placing a hand to her own chest in a self-deprecating manner.  “Is this ship leaving soon for Antonica, by any chance?”<br>
<br>
“I think so,” the Wood Elf shrugged.  “But it won’t be for a while.  The crew were saying something about a heavy fog setting in tonight.”<br>
<br>
“Oh my!” the enchantress breathed.  “Do they know how long the voyage will be delayed?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf shook her head.  “They didn’t say, but I wouldn’t expect to be on your way until at least morning.  Now, please excuse me…”  <br>
<br>
Considering the discussion closed, the fretful Wood Elf made as though to depart when Shalyndrial interrupted her a second time with a sojourning hand.<br>
<br>
“Pardon me again,” she said in her usual gentle tone.  “But I’m afraid I am also unfamiliar with this area.  Might there be a safe place close by to settle for the night?”<br>
<br>
“I really wouldn’t know.  I’m just passing through,” the Wood Elf replied.<br>
<br>
“On your way to Kelethin?” Shalyndrial asked.<br>
<br>
For some reason this had the effect of upsetting the small Wood Elf.  The young woman looked up sharply, pausing a brief moment to compose herself before replying.<br>
<br>
“I-I’m not… really sure,” she said in a small voice.  Raising her hand, she swiped quickly at her eye.<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial tilted her head down to see tears beginning to spill down the Wood Elf’s cheeks.  This was most unusual, the enchantress thought to herself.  Something dreadful must have happened to this poor girl on her journey.<br>
<br>
“My dear, I see something is terribly wrong,” the High Elf said softly, her voice filled with genuine concern.  “May I invite you to join me here for a while?  It would be dangerous for you to travel the wilds in this condition.  Adding to that the fog that is on its way, I would hate to see you fall victim to the many dangers out there alone.”<br>
<br>
The young Wood Elf placed a small finger up against her nose, a sniffle escaping her control.  “I’ll be okay,” she whispered, elbowing her way past the High Elf.<br>
<br>
“Please?” Shalyndrial asked, her tone carefully mild.  “I would love your company for dinner.  You don’t even have to talk about it.  Just take a moment to calm down before going on.  That’s all I ask.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf stopped, the highlights of her hair catching the fiery shades of the sunset behind her, causing the auburn strands to shimmer red against the darkening background of Faydwer.  She turned around cautiously, no longer attempting to hide the tears that glistened on her cheeks.<br>
<br>
“Why?” she asked in a choked voice.<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial smiled sweetly as she stepped forward.  “Because I spend a lot of time at these docks, my dear.  I have seen many different people from all walks of life come through here.  I’ve seen reunions of happiness and excitement.  I’ve seen separations bringing sorrow and sadness.”  The High Elf reached out to place a finger under the small Wood Elf’s chin.  She could feel the wet sensation of tears on her hand as she lifted the young woman’s gaze to meet her own.  “But I have never before have seen such hopelessness as I see in your eyes right now, sweet one.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf backed away slowly, a distrustful look aimed toward the mysterious person standing before her.  Who was this High Elf?  What interest did she have in making her feel better?  Why would she even bother?  What does she want?<br>
<br>
Then the Wood Elf closed her eyes, berating herself with a sigh as she ran an agitated hand through her hair.  Had it truly come to this?  Had she allowed recent events to taint her so much that she instinctively questioned every kind hand extended her way?  Looking into the eyes of this High Elf standing across from her, she could see no hint of malevolence or deceit.  A few months earlier, it would not have even crossed her mind to look.  What had happened to change her so much?  She began to wonder who she really was anymore.<br>
<br>
Slowly, the Wood Elf’s features distorted into a pained expression, her shoulders heaving as she became overcome with silent sobs wracking her body.  Shalyndrial quickly stepped over to the Wood Elf, taking the distressed young woman in her arms, the young druid’s head to rest against her shoulder..<br>
<br>
“I’m in so much trouble,” the Wood Elf sobbed bitterly.  “I don’t know what to do.  I’m so scared, I-”<br>
<br>
“It’s okay,” the High Elf whispered soothingly.  “Don’t think about it right now.  Here, come with me to my room at the inn over there.  You’ll be safe inside, and eating something will make you feel better.  It always does. ”<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” Laera whispered, breaking their embrace.  Together the two stepped down the pier onto dry land, one comforting the other with a reassuring arm around her shoulders.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly the Wood Elf stopped short, turning a suspicious eye toward Shalyndrial.  “Wait a minute,” she said.  “I thought you said you didn’t have a place to stay?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, well…” Shalyndrial looked at the young woman with a sheepish grin.  “You looked as if you needed a friend.  So, I had to come up with something on the spur of the moment to keep you from storming off.”<br>
<br>
Looking up to High Elf’s porcelain features, the young woman couldn’t keep the smile from spreading across her face.  A small chuckle escaped her lips, lending a peculiar contrast to the tears that remained on her cheeks.<br>
<br>
“I see,” she said, her smile broadening.<br>
<br>
The High Elf extended a graceful hand.  “My name is Shalyndrial,” she said, introducing herself cordially.<br>
<br>
“Laera Nellynwae,” the Wood Elf said softly, sniffling meekly before accepting the enchantress’s hand. <br>
<br>
A knowing grin extended across Shalyndrial’s face.  “A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Miss Nellynwae.” <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Laera couldn’t decide if it was Shalyndrial’s ceaselessly kind demeanor, the food, or the familiar surroundings, but the druid felt worlds better after spending time with the High Elf in her rented room.  The entire building was designed to mimic the style of Kelethin, all decked out in polished, ornate wood and open-air windows.  The fragrant scent of cedar pervaded the room, bringing the memory of her home even more vividly to mind.<br>
<br>
Dinner consisted of sourdough bread and a steaming bowl of soup laden thick with succulent meat and vegetables.  Laera thought her taste buds would leap right out of her mouth at the flavor, after so many weeks of eating nothing but standard rations and whatever else she could scrounge up.<br>
<br>
The conversation remained lighthearted as the two Elves discussed the idle pleasures of life on Faydwer, for which Laera was devoutly grateful.  Instead of the doom and gloom of the Pact of Zeranon, the Wood Elf was given leave to focus on the lovely, simple things that made her happy.  For once, it was refreshing to hold a polite conversation with someone who deviated from the dourness and cynicism of her former traveling companion.  Someone she could finally relate to.<br>
<br>
“You should have seen his face when he realized his swimming trunks were long gone,” Laera said, her eyes alight with mirth.  “I never knew an Elf could turn that shade!”<br>
<br>
The sound of Shalyndrial’s heartfelt laughter floated merrily through the room as she let show her appreciation for Laera’s tale at the fishing pond in Felwithe.<br>
<br>
“Oh dear,” the High Elf said once she caught her breath.  “A future paladin!  May the gods protect us all!”<br>
<br>
Laera shook her head good-naturedly, sipping another spoonful of her soup.<br>
<br>
“So, what happened then?” Shalyndrial asked with a twinkle in her eye.<br>
<br>
“I have no idea,” the Wood Elf shrugged.  She popped a portion of the sourdough into her mouth.  “I left.”<br>
<br>
“You left him there?”  The enchantress was aghast.  “What ever happened to his trunks?  Did he ever retrieve them?”<br>
<br>
Laera tilted her head, absently chewing on the bread in her mouth as she tried to remember.  “You know,” she said, swallowing.  “Come to think of it, I have no idea.  I tossed them behind a boulder as I left.”<br>
<br>
The High Elf’s face froze solidly in place, a half-smile gracing her stunned features as she stared at the druid sitting across from her.  “No.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf grinned and nodded emphatically as she stuffed more bread into her mouth.<br>
<br>
“No!”  Shalyndrial insisted, knowing full well her denial was quite mistaken.  “I can’t believe it!  You, my dear, have a heightened sense of vengeance!  I, for one, shudder at the thought of having you angry at me.”<br>
<br>
“That’s what Rigel said,” Laera laughed.<br>
<br>
“Rigel…?” the High Elf inquired.<br>
<br>
“Mmmm,” Laera responded, her mouth full.  Chewing hurriedly, she swallowed to explain. “He’s… well… I guess you could say he was my boyfriend.”<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial opened her mouth wide in a silent “ah” motion, allowing the Wood Elf to continue.<br>
<br>
“He’s a real sweetie.  And he’s talented, too.  He made this tunic for me,” she said, placing two thumbs proudly beneath her leather lapels.<br>
<br>
“May I…?” the High Elf asked, gesturing to the tunic.<br>
<br>
“Sure.  Please do.”<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial’s graceful, white hand reached out to feel the tunic, inspecting the smooth leather with her fingertips.  The enchantress’s appreciative expression turned curious at running her fingers over the tunic’s edge where it met the druid’s skin.<br>
<br>
“What is this lining?” the High Elf asked.<br>
<br>
“Rabbit fur.”  Laera smiled.<br>
<br>
“It’s so soft!” Shalyndrial declared, her voice filled with amazement.  “With this lining, you could easily go without-“<br>
<br>
“I do,” the Wood Elf interrupted with a small grin.<br>
<br>
“Ah, I see.”  Shalyndrial returned Laera’s grin, politely removing her hand.  “I admit it, I am no expert at tailoring.  Still, it seems to be a fine piece of armor.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you.  I think so, too,” Laera responded, downing a chunk of potato from the soup.  “I never knew Rigel had it in him.  It’s amazing how you think you know someone over the years and then they pull something like this on you.  It came as such a surprise when he gave it to me.”<br>
<br>
“A lover’s gift?” The High Elf asked with a sly grin.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s own smile faded slightly, her demeanor losing its cheer.  “Ah…no,” she said softly.  “A goodbye gift.”<br>
<br>
“Oh… I see,” Shalyndrial said, her own demeanor politely growing solemn.  “I’m terribly sorry.  It looks as if he took quite a shine to you at one time.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked down at the tunic she wore.  “I believe he did,” she said softly, more to herself than to the High Elf.  “And I him at one time, even if I was too blind to see it.”<br>
<br>
The enchantress ate a few spoonfuls of soup, leaving the Wood Elf to her own thoughts for a few moments before speaking.  “If I may be so bold…” she began, clearing her throat.<br>
<br>
“Certainly,” Laera looked up at the High Elf.<br>
<br>
“May I ask what happened to separate you?” Shalyndrial said hesitantly.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s gaze became abstracted as she searched for some means to answer properly.<br>
<br>
“My life turned upside-down,” she said at last, not finding any.  Her words came out slowly.  “It changed into something it should never have been.  It became warped and twisted until it was unrecognizable.”  Laera placed her bowl down firmly on the table, the spoon clinking.  “Until I became unrecognizable!”<br>
<br>
Looking up, Laera saw the beautiful enchantress sitting across from her, listening with a genuinely sympathetic ear.  The Wood Elf realized she was heading down a dangerous path with this line of conversation.<br>
<br>
“You know, you have been so kind and considerate,” she said hurriedly, rising from her seat to a half-crouch.  She busied her hands with cleaning up her dinner’s mess.  “You really don’t need to hear the life troubles of a stranger, and here I’ve kept you up until three in the morning.  I really should be heading out, even if-“<br>
<br>
The porcelain white skin of the High Elf’s fingers halted Laera’s tan hands in mid-shuffle.  Looking up, the Wood Elf’s gaze met the clear blue eyes of the enchantress.<br>
<br>
“Go, if you must,” Shalyndrial said in a near-whisper.  “Just understand that I didn’t stop you because you looked hungry.  I didn’t stop you for pleasant conversation, either.  I saw another person in pain, and I wanted to help.”  The High Elf paused, allowing her words to sink in a moment before she continued.  “You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t wish to.  But believe me, I have come to know the value of a compassionate ear.  A very kind man extended me his one time when I needed it most.  Please allow me the privilege of extending mine to you now?”<br>
<br>
Laera looked from one eye to the other as she considered Shalyndrial’s words.  Slowly, the Wood Elf sank back down into her wooden chair, her gaze falling to rest on the enchantress’s hand resting on her own against the tabletop.  She swallowed nervously, forcing herself to speak before she changed her mind.<br>
<br>
“Remember what I said at the dock?” she asked, her face blank as though in a daze.<br>
<br>
“You said you were in trouble,” Shalyndrial answered, nodding gently.  <br>
<br>
The Wood Elf rubbed her forehead nervously, letting out a small sigh.  “Trouble… doesn’t come close to doing it justice.  You see, I-” Laera’s voice caught in her throat.  She swallowed again to speak, her voice quivering slightly.  “I abandoned my companion, and broke a solemn oath.”<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial waited to see if the distressed Wood Elf had anything to add.  Moments passed before she spoke.  “And you regret your decision?” <br>
<br>
Laera’s jaw worked, but no words came out.  The Wood Elf began to tremble, causing Shalyndrial to bring her other hand forth, taking the frightened young woman’s hands in both her own.<br>
<br>
“I-I don’t… know.”  Tears began to well in the druid’s eyes again as she spoke.  “I shouldn’t have left… but I couldn’t stay…”<br>
<br>
“What made you leave?” Shalyndrial’s voice was filled with kind concern.<br>
<br>
Laera rolled her eyes, wondering where to begin.  Rather than spend the time in relating the long, drawn-out story, the Wood Elf decided to spit out the short version.  “She… she was a… a Teir’Dal,” <br>
<br>
The enchantress sat erect, her face paling even more, if that were possible.  “A Dark Elf?” she asked in disbelief, to which Laera nodded in confirmation.  “What on Norrath possessed you to travel with one of their kind, child?”<br>
<br>
“It-it… I can’t go into it right now,” Laera said, tripping over her own tongue.  Breaking the High Elf’s hold on her hands, she waved them about.  “It’s a long story, and I’m not supposed to talk about it.”<br>
<br>
“No, no. That’s fine,” Shalyndrial said reassuringly.  Bereft of their charge, the High Elf pulled her hands back to place them in her lap beneath the table.  “So, you are afraid this…Dark Elf companion of yours will come seeking revenge?”<br>
<br>
Laera sighed, closing her eyes.  “If only it were that simple,” she said wearily.  “Dreketh’s temper is the least of my problems right now.”<br>
<br>
“Oh,” the High Elf said, confused.  “Then, I’m not sure I see the problem?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s mind raced with the dilemma of how she was to explain things without revealing anything about the Pact.  She wasn’t even sure how much was a secret or how much would be safe to tell.<br>
<br>
“The problem…You-if I… I don’t-“ she said in a jumble.<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial interrupted by making soft shushing noises, as though cooing an infant.  “It’s okay,” she said.  “Take a deep breath.  Relax.  If you feel it might violate a confidence, I understand perfectly.  Why don’t you just tell me about this companion of yours, instead?  Dreketh, was it?”<br>
<br>
“Dreketh,” Laera said absently, taking a moment to calm down.  “What’s to say about her?  She’s a scheming, murdering Teir’Dal like they all are.”<br>
<br>
“What happened that made you leave her?” Shalyndrial asked.<br>
<br>
Laera pressed her lips together angrily.  “She killed a man – a Human,” she said bitterly.  Taking a long breath through her nose, she steeled herself for her next statement.  “What was worse is… I helped her.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf looked up hesitantly, finding the enchantress’s face serious but not recriminating.<br>
<br>
“She tricked me into doing it.  I thought everything was well in hand,” Laera burst out, at last finding a release.  “I didn’t know what she intended, I swear it on Tunare’s faith!  I didn’t know!  I didn’t know!”<br>
<br>
“Shh, it’s okay.  Calm down.  I believe you, Laera.  I promise.  Truly, I do.”  Shalyndrial placated the insistent Wood Elf.  “What happened next?”<br>
<br>
“I-I couldn’t take it,” the Wood Elf said sullenly.  “After all that happened – after screaming at her for tricking me into betraying my faith, I-… that’s when I left.”<br>
<br>
“You turned your back and walked away?”<br>
<br>
“Well, no… I, erm… I cast the Gate spell.”<br>
<br>
“You opened a Gate?” Shalyndrial asked with mild surprise.  “Where on Norrath did this take place?”<br>
<br>
Laera winced and spoke timidly.  “Qeynos Hills?”<br>
<br>
The High Elf’s eyebrows shot up.  Leaning forward, she whispered confidentially.  “You abandoned a Teir’Dal clear on the other side of Norrath?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf nodded, still wincing.<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial looked around herself in disbelief as she sat back.  “Is she at about your level of training?” <br>
<br>
Again, the Wood Elf nodded.<br>
<br>
“Oh dear,” the High Elf said.  “The gods alone would be able to deliver her from those lands by herself.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked up at Shalyndrial’s matter-of-fact tone.  “You… you really think so?”  <br>
<br>
The enchantress returned the Wood Elf’s gaze with a serious nod.<br>
<br>
A pang of guilt pulled at Laera.  After completing her spell and appearing before the entrance to Freeport, the Wood Elf had felt a number of emotions.  It didn’t take her long before realizing the impact of what she had done.  A flood of unforeseen questions entered her mind.  What was to happen next?  Was the Pact still binding?  Did Tunare still expect her to seek the Chalice, or was this truly the end?  Moreover, was she going to return to Kelethin and admit her failure before Head Mistress Netheel, or worse Yeolarn Bronzeleaf himself?  The memory she held of their last encounter when the high priest reluctantly selected her for the Pact sent chills down her spine.<br>
<br>
Not once did she stop to consider these questions on her companion’s behalf.    What did Innoruuk expect of Dreketh?  Was she, in fact, going to continue seeking the Chalice on her own?  Where was she to go now that Laera had left?<br>
<br>
An inexplicable heaviness pressed against the Wood Elf’s chest, making it difficult to breathe.  For all her overtures of respecting life and her refusal of being a party to murder, she realized she might be singularly responsible for the death of her companion.  True, the Dark Elf was the result of a perverse creation of Innoruuk, but for some reason that didn’t matter to Laera just then.  Even though she meant every word she had said in the Hills, the thought of Dreketh lying torn and bleeding after falling victim to the dangers of central Antonica sent the druid’s stomach to nausea.<br>
<br>
“Sweet Tunare, beloved Mother,” Laera said fervently.  “If she dies, it will be my fault.  There would be no trickery or excuse this time, it would be my fault because I wasn’t there!”<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial’s calm expression offered no comment.<br>
<br>
“It’s true, isn’t it?” the Wood Elf demanded, standing suddenly.  “She may already be dead right now, and I’m the one responsible!  Dear gods above…”<br>
<br>
The High Elf pressed her lips together, her expression thoughtful as she raised her hand to quiet the panicked Wood Elf.  “Child, I really don’t wish to upset you.  Please think rationally about this.  You don’t know for certain what, if anything, has happened-“<br>
<br>
“No.  No I don’t,” Laera responded, shaking her head violently.  “That’s because I’m not there to see!  I’m not where I belong!”<br>
<br>
“Laera, please.”  Shalyndrial spoke in such a serene voice, it affected the Wood Elf more profoundly than if the enchantress had stood up and demanded her silence.  Laera slowly resumed her seat to hear what the High Elf had to say, her look of alarm still unwavering.<br>
<br>
The High Elf interlaced her fingers together, trying to decide how best to proceed.  “My dear child,” she said with sincerity.  “I don’t know what your situation is exactly, so please understand that I cannot say anything with certainty.  I don’t know who your friend is, or if what you did was the right or wrong thing to do.”<br>
<br>
Laera glanced up sharply at the High Elf’s usage of the word “friend,” but made no comment as she listened.<br>
<br>
“Only you can determine what the consequences of your actions have been,” Shalyndrial went on to say.  “There is only one thing I can say with full confidence, and that is you cannot undo what you have done.  Once you realize what the consequences of your actions may be, you must choose what you will do about them in the here and now.  That is all any of us have to work with, really ” she said with a shrug.<br>
<br>
Laera swallowed hard, listening to the High Elf’s words of wisdom.  Of course, what Shalyndrial said was true.  As much as she wished it, nothing can turn the clock around – not even the power of gods.  The lucid part of Laera took over, making her realize that panic was not going to help matters any.  Gradually, her heart stopped pounding so hard.  She breathed easier and began to think more clearly.  <br>
<br>
“Now,” the enchantress continued.  “From what you know of your companion, what would be the first thing she would do after you left?”<br>
<br>
“Before or after she swore eternal damnation on my soul?” Laera asked, her voice filled with despair.<br>
<br>
“After that,” Shalyndrial said, finding it difficult to keep the grin from her face.<br>
<br>
“Well, her first goal would be to get as far away from the west as possible,” the Wood Elf said.  “The people of the Karanas… well, they didn’t take to her kindly.  That means going back through some dangerous places alone – including Kithicor.  She might have returned to Odus instead, but I don’t think that’s likely.”<br>
<br>
“Why not?” the High Elf urged.<br>
<br>
“It would be as bad or worse than the alternative,” Laera explained.  “Together, we managed to sneak her through Qeynos, but without me as a lookout, her chances of making it thought the city are slim.  I think it would be her preferred choice, but I really doubt she would try it on her own.”<br>
<br>
Laera toyed with her spoon, swirling it through the cooling soup in the bowl before her.  “I have to go back, don’t I?” she said, her small mouth frowning.  “I have to go look for her.”<br>
<br>
Shalyndrial merely sat in silence, knowing that the Wood Elf wasn’t truly seeking an answer, or any sort of confirmation.  The enchanter could see that Laera had already made up her mind about what needed to be done.  The only question remaining was if she would actually go through with it or not.  The power struggle taking place within left its mark on the outside.<br>
<br>
“And if I find her, I’ll have to stay with her until our task is done,” Laera continued, her expression reminding Shalyndrial strongly of a child who was loath to take her medicine, but swallowed the bitter amalgam nonetheless.  A single tear crept down the Wood Elf’s cheek as she stole a small glance up at her High Elf friend.  Shalyndrial could think of no proper reaction to make, outside of a friendly smile.<br>
<br>
“Thank you so much, Lady Shalyndrial, for giving me this respite,” the Wood Elf said, returning the smile sadly.  “Our time together has reminded me of who I am.  I think I forgot that in all the tumult my life has become lately.”<br>
<br>
“The decision you make is not an easy one, child,” Shalyndrial replied.  “Most individuals I know would not have the courage to choose the path you have.  As time progresses, sometimes I begin to think that responsibility for one’s actions is becoming an outmoded concept in place of narcissism and selfishness.”  The High Elf’s smile broadened.  “Then someone like you comes along who gives me hope.  Believe me, whatever gift I may have given you tonight has been repaid tenfold.”<br>
<br>
Laera felt her cheeks flush slightly at the enchantress’s compliment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Second only to sunsets was Shalyndrial’s passion for sunrises.  Even though nothing could rival the fiery reds and oranges darkening to the deep blue shades of night, she could not deny that the peaches and yellows of a new day’s birth were breathtaking in their own right.  The rays of the rising sun streaked across the sky to fall against the top of the ship’s masts in the early morning.  <br>
<br>
The seaport was filled with numerous people boarding the ship, the official word being that she was scheduled to depart shortly after dawn.  Though the fog had long ago lifted at the approach of daybreak, a thin layer of frost remained dusting the ground in the chill morning.  <br>
<br>
Shalyndrial pulled her shawl closer about her shoulders as she leaned against the doorframe to the small inn.  In the distance, she watched her Wood Elf friend-in-passing step up the gangplank.  The small, leather-clad figure stopped only once to turn and wave her final goodbyes.  The High Elf smiled sadly, raising her own hand in return.  Though Laera wished to Gate back to Antonica so as to begin her search as quickly as possible, Shalyndrial convinced the young druid that the time spent sailing back could be well spent in thought as she decided who she was, and what role she wished to play once she was reunited with her friend.<br>
<br>
“May you take Erollisi’s Love with you on your journey.  May it light all the dark places you must walk, sweet one,” she whispered, watching Laera disappear among the crowd.  “Erollisi’s divine love, and my own.”<br>
<br>
“The prayer of parting?” a furtive voice spoke from around the corner of the inn.  “If I am not mistaken, such a prayer is reserved for close friends – even family.  She travels by sea.  Perhaps a hymn to Prexus would be in order, if you care so deeply for her welfare?”<br>
<br>
The enchantress’s placid eyes didn’t flinch once at the familiar sound of the ranger’s voice.  “If Prexus listened to the words of Elves, I would offer it without pause,” she said softly, watching the final preparations being made to set sail.  “What are you doing here?  I thought you returned to Antonica.”<br>
<br>
“Who says I didn’t?” the ranger asked.<br>
<br>
“The port has been fogged in all night,” Shalyndrial argued in her usual serene tone.<br>
<br>
“There are more ways than one to cross the Ocean of Tears,” he said with finality.  “The important thing is that I was successful.”<br>
<br>
The High Elf broke her gaze, turning her head toward the ranger’s voice.  “The Dark Elf is safe, then?” she asked, her voice carefully controlled.<br>
<br>
The ranger paused at the unexpected question.  “She told you, did she?”<br>
<br>
“What she told me is between me and her,” Shalyndrial said smoothly.  “I asked you if her companion is safe.”<br>
<br>
“In a manner of speaking,” he replied evenly.<br>
<br>
“Your encouragement overwhelms me, Ranin,” Shalyndrial said dryly, her eyes returning to the ship.<br>
<br>
“She is alive,” the ranger elaborated.  “And for now, that is the best we can hope for.”<br>
<br>
Reflected in the depths of the High Elf’s tender eyes, the vessel began to move, veering away on its journey toward the west.  Normally, the faultlessly romantic Shalyndrial would have composed a few words in her mind, fitfully honoring the setting’s awe-inspiring beauty.  But that morning, the mental words fell broken and useless at her feet as she watched the ship’s flight into the sea.<br>
<br>
“I fear very shortly that will be true of us all.”<br>
<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 15 - Homecomings</c><br>
<br>
Dreketh stood alone at the far end of the stone bridge, her face downcast.  In her limp hand rested her father’s sword, the bloodstained blade similarly downcast to lie against the dirt path at her feet as if the shadow knight lacked the strength to raise it to its scabbard.<br>
<br>
The road to Nektulos had not been kind.  The Dark Elf’s face shown cut and bruised by the harrowing days of her journey, hidden as it was behind a curtain of matted hair.  The once gleaming armor on her shoulders now shown beaten and lackluster – evidence of the trials she had endured.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh’s azure eyes peered sharply at the two guards standing watch across the bridge extending before her – the very same bridge she had been forced to run across in her banishment so many weeks ago.  Though downtrodden and battered, the shadow knight’s weary vigil held a grim pride all its own as she waited for the one she knew must inevitably come to meet her.  <br>
<br>
There was every possibility she was about to die.  By all rights, she should be killed for ignoring the mandate of exile by her people.  Nevertheless, Dreketh decided to put Kella N’Threk and his so-called mandate to the test.  It was a gamble.  Even though she guessed that the Pact of Zeranon placed her survival above that of Neriak law, nothing said that another advocate of Innoruuk couldn’t be selected in the event she was killed.  Such an event would be a profound setback, however, and Dreketh was betting that such a setback would not be afforded unless absolutely necessary.<br>
<br>
And even if it was to be afforded, the thought of her life ending was not entirely unwelcome.  These days of solitary travel had given the Dark Elf plenty of time to think things through.  She realized how everything she had and everything she was had been sacrificed for this infernal Pact.  Broken or not, the Pact of Zeranon had left her bereft of everything she held dear.  The actions of one insignificant Wood Elf made it all meaningless, and such ignominy made Dreketh rail against her situation.  Whatever the cause and no matter the future, one way or another she had been cheated out of her life, never to recapture it.<br>
<br>
No, death was not at all unwelcome, she thought to herself as she watched the hand of death approach from across the bridge.  It came in the form of one familiar captain dressed in the trappings of a temple guard.  His measured steps rang in the shadow knight’s ears as he made his unhurried approach.<br>
<br>
“Well, well… what have we here?” he said, coming to a halt before her.  “I knew I smelled the stench of an Elf lover from the moment I entered the forest.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh remained motionless and silent, her eyes staring clear through Captain N’Farre as if he didn’t exist.<br>
<br>
“Curious,” the captain pressed on.  “I don’t see your pet Wood Elf anywhere.  Is she in hiding, perhaps?  Or has her entertainment value worn thin, and you’ve come seeking a substitute among your former brethren?”<br>
<br>
“I demand to see Kella N’Threk,” Dreketh said in a monotone.<br>
<br>
“I’m afraid that is not possible.”  N’Farre folded his arms, taking several strolling steps around the shadow knight as he spoke.  “The old priest is practically on his deathbed, you see.  It would be improper for him to expose himself to the cold night air just to speak to you.  I would hate to think of the consequences if he died from catering to your foolish request.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s jaw muscles clenched.  The scathing captain had meandered out of her field of vision, but she could feel the tingling sensation of his presence at the back of her neck as he spoke softly into her ear.<br>
<br>
“But I will oblige you in taking you to our Father’s temple,” he said in a soothing voice that mocked her with subtle threat.   “You will see it most clearly as we pass right on by on your way to the Lodge of the Dead.  I told you if you returned that it would be my pleasure to show you how we deal with Elf lovers.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh tossed her head irritably to one side, the captain’s hot breath annoying her.  “If you wish to kill me, do it and be done.  I grow tired of your worthless banter,” she said sharply.  <br>
<br>
“Nothing would please me more,” the captain said, continuing his leisurely pace around the disgraced shadow knight.  “But as long as Priest N’Threk lives, so does his sanction of your life.  No, I’m afraid I cannot offer you your just desserts at the moment, palatable as the thought may be.”<br>
<br>
The captain drew his sword.  In one quick motion his blade clashed with Dreketh’s, knocking it from her unresisting hand to fall on the dusty path.  The tired and battle-worn Dark Elf remained motionless, silently withstanding her lecture.<br>
<br>
“Instead, I am forced to offer you our hospitality,” the captain continued, bringing the flat of his blade up below Dreketh’s chin, raising it.  “The very same hospitality we offer other important visitors we receive here in Nektulos from time to time.  You, my dear, will be the honored guest of one Noxhil V’Sek.  I’m sure you are familiar with his work.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s breathing grew heavy.  Of course she knew V’Sek work.  The man’s prowess at inflicting pain and keeping his victims alive during the process was legendary among the Teir’Dal – and among the practitioners of necromancy in particular.  Nights in the Lodge of the Dead were often filled with the strangled cries of his victims.  Some were shouts of agony while others were simpering pleas for it to end.  No light dweller withstood the torturer’s skilled talents.  Even hardened warriors were known to literally cry out in tears for their mothers while under his care.  Devout followers of gods had renounced their beliefs in exchange for the promise release of death.  <br>
<br>
Torture alone was not the only motivation for Noxil V’Sek’s work, however.  The talented Dark Elf was an accomplished scientist as well, fully knowledgeable in the ways of magic and how it relates to living creatures.  The results of his grotesque experiments were well known.  <br>
<br>
One experiment in particular had always stood out in Dreketh’s mind.  It involved a human male.  She remembered seeing the man’s tortured throes as he lay naked on a stone slab in the gruesome laboratory, his arms and legs bound securely to each of the four corners.  V’Sek harbored an idle curiosity to see if the Teir’Dal’s already unsurpassed night vision could be further enhanced in some way.  To those ends, he made use of a precise technique of magical surgery he had developed for this experiment.  Carefully, he removed the man’s eyes and replaced them with those of a captured fire beetle.  The use of any form of anesthetic or sedation was deemed unnecessary – as this was merely a Human, after all, caught wandering Nektulos Forest in his foolishness.  <br>
<br>
Ignoring the man’s shrieks of pain and anguish, Dreketh had watched fascinated as V’Sek completed the delicate procedure.  As fate would have it, the torturer’s efforts were in vain.  Even though it had been obvious the man could still see to some degree, what he saw through the eyes of an insect had driven him completely mad.   He became uncontrollably frenzied as he glanced around the room with glowing red eyes that were not his own.  In the end, the Human’s life was mercifully terminated – the incomprehensible ramblings of a man gone insane hardly being useful to the experiment.  All the same, V’Sek made a thorough record of events for reference to use on his next attempt sometime in the future when another suitable victim was captured.<br>
<br>
Dreketh could hear the frantic beating of her own heart as she fought to retain her composure.  “You would do no such thing,” she said, her voice quivering only once.  The captain’s sword remained poised against the underside of her chin, its tip biting into the soft, fleshy part of her jaw.<br>
<br>
“I am delighted to show you just how serious I am,” N’Farre replied, his tone ominously cheerful.  “Not only that, but I have been invited to attend the proceedings and report on the outcome to my superiors personally.”  The captain’s smile broadened with a leer.  “I shall relish the sight of you stripped and bleeding on our esteemed Noxhil V’Sek’s  prize table.  It will be the first time in years that the blood of a traitor has mingled with the blood of light dwellers staining the laboratory floor.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight’s labored breathing became visibly stronger.  She swallowed, her jaw muscles clenching in a fraught effort to remain calm.  Seeing this inner struggle, the captain leaned in closer, his blade unwavering.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps V’Sek will be so kind as to give me the opportunity of participating in his work,” he muttered.  “It would be an honor to serve him by personally sanctifying the Third Gate of Neriak with the open screams of a traitor such as yourself.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s resolve broke as fear overcame her.  A muted sob escaped her control as she quickly withdrew her chin from off the captain’s blade.  Fully expecting this reaction, the captain reached out to take the shadow knight’s arm in his hand.  <br>
<br>
In a dazed attempt to flee the forest, Dreketh thrashed her arm about, trying desperately to dislodge the man’s firm hold.  The wild notion crossed her mind that perhaps if she gave him enough trouble, he would resort to killing her anyway.  Her hopes were dashed, however, as she felt his other arm wrap itself around her abdomen, holding her firmly from behind.  Too weak from her journey to put up any respectable struggle, Dreketh squirmed helplessly in the captain’s stalwart clutches as she heard him call out to the guards on the other side of the bridge.<br>
<br>
“Detachment approach!” he yelled sharply.  “Take this traitorous wench to the Lodge.  As you can see, she is anxious to see her ancient home again!”<br>
<br>
All hope lost, the shadow knight screamed in a panicked frenzy as she felt the guards’ hands brutally grab hold of her limbs.  Without pause, Dreketh was held aloft by the robust guards and carried like so much baggage across the bridge to her fate amidst the shrouding darkness of Nektulos Forest.<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 16 - Reunion</c><br>
<br>
As a field mouse approaches the gaping maw of a lion, so did Laera creep her way up the sand dunes toward the gaping maw of the Tunnel of Ro.  This was her second stop in the hapless search for her absent companion, having found no sign of the shadow knight at the militia house in Freeport.  None of the city guard recalled allowing a Dark Elf to stay the night over the past several days, nor did any recall having one ask for such a favor.<br>
<br>
Laera couldn’t help but notice how high tensions seemed to be in the city that day.  Garrisons near the west gate were easily doubled since her last visit, not only ranked with members of the militia but also paladins who normally patrolled the north part of the city.  Such an occurrence seemed peculiar to the druid, but none of the guards were willing to discuss the matter when she broached the subject.<br>
<br>
Rumors on the street ranged from a planned attack to liberate the Tunnel of Ro to an impending orc invasion from the Commonlands.  Whispered gossip spoke of politics between Freeport and Neriak becoming uneasy once again.  Eventually, Laera decided to give up in her efforts to discover the truth in lieu of matters more pressing.<br>
<br>
The enormity of her task hit the druid fully as she began her search for Dreketh.  If the Dark Elf had decided to go into hiding, it was possible the Wood Elf could wind up searching for months.  There was simply no knowing what had become of her companion.  Laera therefore decided to retrace her steps, traveling to places where they had been together in the past, with the hopes that Dreketh would be doing the same.  <br>
<br>
Nightly, the Wood Elf prayed to Tunare for forgiveness and guidance to set things right again.  Inevitably, her heartfelt prayers ended with a devout plea to protect Dreketh from any harm that might befall her.<br>
<br>
A whispered prayer on behalf of a Teir’Dal, Laera thought to herself.  She shook her head at the irony, wondering how many times in the past anyone had prayed to the Mother of All to protect the welfare of a Dark Elf.  Probably not too many, she thought.<br>
<br>
Suppressing a slight twinge of claustrophobia quivering through her stomach, the druid walked with outward confidence through the tunnel entrance.  Several stragglers made their way past her on their way outside.  Whether they were recent patrons of the swashbuckler’s market or travelers from the desert to the south, Laera couldn’t tell.  Not that it mattered much to her.  She didn’t plan on staying long in any event.  One quick look through the marketplace and she would be on her way ever westward.<br>
<br>
Westward.  The thought of crossing Kithicor and the Karanas again made the Wood Elf feel like vomiting.  The relief she once felt at deftly avoiding that journey with the Gate spell was all for naught, so it seemed, as she was about to undertake that journey anyway – albeit from the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
At least I can camouflage myself this time, she thought to herself.  Without Dreketh’s stubborn refusal to be “desecrated by Tunare’s loathsome power,” traveling incognito suddenly became far simpler for the druid.  Still, it remained to be seen how useful her camouflage magic was against the undead legions of Kithicor.  She had heard rumors that even the coveted undead invisibility spells of clerics remained ineffective against those particular minions of the dead.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf winced slightly as she approached the flickering light of the marketplace down the tunnel.  Throwing her shoulders back, she did her best to work a kink out of her spine.  Already her body ached, and she was only a couple of days into her journey.  Sighing heavily, Laera paused to rub her eyes before entering the cavern.  Tomorrow, she thought.  Tomorrow would be the day she headed out.  She needed ample time to rest herself.  Besides, she didn’t like the look of the clouds gathering to the west.  With her luck, it was going to rain again that evening, making any prospect of traveling a miserable one.<br>
<br>
Taking a deep breath, Laera stepped into the marketplace, her eyes darting here and there through the throngs of various people going about their business.  At first, a few blue-skinned figures caught her eye, but none wearing the ever-present bronze armor.  Try as she might, she didn’t see her companion anywhere inside.  The handful of Dark Elves who were gracing the marketplace with their presence was small that day, and it was obvious none of them were Dreketh.<br>
<br>
The thought of asking if anyone had seen a Dark Elf matching the shadow knight’s description crossed Laera’s mind.  After all, information was a huge part of what the swashbuckler’s market was about, and hence its partisans remained vigilant to a fault.  By that same token, information was a huge commodity in this place as well.  The lightness of Laera’s money pouch made her rethink the notion, not to mention the fact that she wasn’t too fond of the idea that certain unfriendlies who knew about the Pact of Zeranon might come around asking for her whereabouts.<br>
<br>
Shaking her head to herself, Laera decided it would be best to make a hasty exit before too many people took note of her.  She took several steps back toward the entrance when a slight movement out of the corner of her eye caught her attention.  <br>
<br>
Turning, the Wood Elf squinted into the shadows, her enhanced Elven vision showing the soft, red glow of someone sitting beneath a familiar makeshift lean-to.  Laera recognized it as the same lean-to where she had first met Dreketh weeks ago.  The figure sat cross-legged in the surrounding darkness, its head lowered morosely.<br>
<br>
Was it possible?  Grabbing a nearby torch from the wall, Laera approached cautiously to get a closer look at the dejected person.  The closer she got, the more her hopes rose, as the individual’s features grew increasingly recognizable.  The anonymous figure became a female.  The female transformed into an Elf.  The Elf’s skin shown an unmistakable shade of blue as the light from the torch illuminated it, the unkempt hair a sullied, tangled mass of white.  Instead of armor, the Dark Elf wore a strapped red undershirt, her lap covered with a worn blanket.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh?”  The Wood Elf spoke in a small voice.  Leaning forward slightly to one side, Laera tried to get a clear look at the downcast face.  Her efforts were rewarded as the figure’s head lifted at the sound of her voice.  What met the druid’s eyes made her gasp an oath.  “Tunare’s mercy!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh groaned slightly, shading her eyes from the torch’s sudden light.  Her eyes blinked narrowly as she sought to bring the druid’s blurry visage into focus.  “Wood Elf…?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, it’s me.  It’s… Laera,” the Wood Elf spoke mildly, her eyes never once leaving the face of her companion.  Aghast, Laera knelt on the ground as she took in Dreketh’s appearance.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf’s sharp, refined features were stained with dried blood streaking from her nose, mouth and a lengthy cut across her forehead.  Her cheeks were battered and bruised, swollen grotesquely  to form a misshapen welt to one side of her lips.  Unidentifiable grime soiled nearly every inch of the shadow knight’s abused face.<br>
<br>
Tense moments passed as Dreketh’s vision cleared enough to focus on the druid resting before her.  The azure eyes became piercing in their expression, aimed directly at Tunare’s advocate.  The Dark Elf’s thin brow furrowed low.  Her lips curled, revealing an assortment of clenched white teeth laced with crimson red in between.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh’s breathing came in shaky gasps as she stared at the Wood Elf.  The encrusted tendrils of the Dark Elf’s hair quivered before her eyes as she began to tremble.  Laera steeled herself for the vehement explosion she knew was imminent, when she noticed tears forming in Dreketh’s eyes.  A short, gasping sob burst through the Dark Elf’s clenched teeth, and she closed her eyes, causing the tears to pour down her cheeks.  The shadow knight turned her head back down, covering her face with her hands as she began weeping like a child.  <br>
<br>
The tenderhearted Wood Elf reached out a hand.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh, it is you!  What in the world ha-?”  Laera’s question was cut short.  A warm, sticky sensation reached her hand as it touched the Dark Elf’s bare shoulder.  Turning her palm upward, she saw it was marred red, fresh with blood.  <br>
<br>
Immediately concerned, the Wood Elf craned her head forward to examine the shadow knight.  Pulling the straps of Dreketh’s shirt away from her skin, Laera discovered a dreadful assortment of deep, bleeding gashes all across the Dark Elf’s shoulders and back.  Though scabbed over to some small degree, Dreketh’s movements had brutally reopened them.<br>
<br>
“Dearest gods above, what happened to you?”  Laera whispered to the sobbing Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry,” Dreketh whispered as she grasped at Laera’s armor with desperate hands.  “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry …Please stay with me.  Don’t go.  Please, don’t leave me again.  Please, please, please…” The Dark Elf’s beseeching words were lost amidst another bout of inaudible sobbing.<br>
<br>
Laera placed a hesitant arm around the Dark Elf’s shoulders.  The shock of seeing the once strong and seemingly indomitable shadow knight like this had thrown her.  She wasn’t at all sure what she should do to comfort the Teir’Dal.<br>
<br>
“It’s okay, I’m here.  I’m not going anywhere,” she whispered, lightly patting the top of her companion’s shoulder to avoid touching the hideous injuries.  <br>
<br>
The Dark Elf continued weeping as she wrapped her bruised arms around the druid’s neck, clutching as though she were drowning in deep ocean waters.  Laera was completely taken aback at the shadow knight’s bewildering behavior.  She had expected a bitter reunion, resulting in hot words, reproach, threats – she even half-expected to be attacked on sight.  But tears?  Pleas for forgiveness?  Laera couldn’t imagine what could possibly have caused this puzzling change in her companion.<br>
<br>
Pulling back gently, the druid took on an air of competence.  “Okay, I’m going to heal your wounds…”<br>
<br>
“No!” Dreketh cried, suddenly alarmed.  “No, you can’t do that!”<br>
<br>
“You’ve made your opinion well known,” the Wood Elf argued in return, holding the weakened Teir’Dal by the arms.  “But if I don’t at least close the wounds they’ll turn infectious-“<br>
<br>
“No!” Dreketh shouted insistently, her eyes filled with terror  “You don’t understand!  They were inflicted with the Scion of Innoruuk as my punishment for breaking the Pact.  If you heal them with magic it will kill me.  Please don’t do it!  I can’t die – not yet!  Please!”<br>
<br>
“Okay, okay,” Laera said, holding her hands up reassuringly.  “No magic, I promise.  Calm down.  I won’t do anything, I swear.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf slumped down, sighing in relief.<br>
<br>
“But at least let me wash and bandage them or something to keep them clean,” the Wood Elf said with obvious concern for the wounds’ severity.  “These cuts are so deep, I’m worried if they stay like this, your life may be endangered in any case.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh winced and swallowed as the druid made a brief examination of her back and shoulders.  “They must be cleansed and cauterized,” she said, her voice strained.  “It is part of the ritual.  Otherwise they will never fully heal.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked at the wounds with amazement as she reached into her pack and pulled out a water flask and washcloth.  “Never?  What foul magics are at work here?”<br>
<br>
“It is Innoruuk’s own hate and his dis-“  Dreketh’s voice seized as Laera began to wash a tender spot on her shoulder.  “…displeasure with my failure.”<br>
<br>
“Failure?  No,” Laera said with conviction.  “I was the one who broke the Pact.  I was the one who left you, not the other way around!”<br>
<br>
“It doesn’t matter,” Dreketh replied through clenched teeth as the druid worked.  “It was my responsibility to keep you from leaving.  Instead, I drove you away.  That’s why they punished me.”<br>
<br>
“Who punished you?” Laera asked, pausing in her attempts to clean the wounds.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s only response was a brief, sheepish glance before pointedly avoiding the Wood Elf’s gaze.  She still trembled slightly, though Laera could plainly see it wasn’t from the pain of the wounds.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight’s reaction said it all.<br>
<br>
“You returned to Neriak?” Laera whispered in astonishment.  Seeing the Dreketh’s tremulous nod, she asked further.  “By all the gods, what did you do that for?”<br>
<br>
“Where else?” Dreketh replied, her eyes weary.  “I had no idea what to do or where to go.  I didn’t know what was to become of me once the Pact was broken.  For a while, I thought about running away.  Hiding.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf cringed at hearing her own dilemmas repeated back to her, but said nothing as she returned to her gruesome task of cleansing her companion’s back.<br>
<br>
“But Kella N’Threk has ways of finding people who don’t want to be found,” the Dark Elf continued.  Now that she had regained control of her emotions, she wiped the tears from her cheeks with a quick hand.  “I decided it wouldn’t be worth it.  Instead of being hunted down and dragged back to Neriak, I thought it would be best if I returned on my own.  At least that way there was a small chance I would be allowed to consult with N’Threk about what was to happen next.”<br>
<br>
“And if not…?” Laera asked quietly as she worked.<br>
<br>
Dreketh swallowed, hesitating.  “I expected them to kill me.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s hand stopped dabbing at Dreketh’s wounds for half a second.  The Wood Elf could not suppress the odd tingling sensation she felt sweeping across her skin at hearing those words, knowing that she would have been the one responsible.  Closing her eyes, Laera rid herself of that thought – it was already difficult enough seeing what did happen.<br>
<br>
“Without you, my usefulness to Innoruuk was at an end,” the Dark Elf continued.  “I had no purpose, no people, no family.  No god.  In a way, I was almost eager for it.  I never imagined that they would…” She swallowed heavily.  “…That they would let me live.”<br>
<br>
The two sat in silence.  Laera, tried her best to wipe the dirt and grime from Dreketh’s wounds, but she was fast approaching the point where she had done all she could do with the blood-soaked washcloth and the small bit of water she had left.<br>
<br>
“How did you get here?” she asked softly.<br>
<br>
“I was ordered here,” Dreketh replied.  “After they finished with me, they said to return to the spot where we first met and to stay here without food or drink until either you returned or until I died of thirst, whichever came first.”<br>
<br>
Overcome, Laera closed her eyes.  She raised the back of her hand to her forehead, the red of the Dark Elf’s blood smearing across her tan skin.  “I’m so sorry, Dreketh,” she whispered.  “This is all my fault.  Everything that happened to you-“<br>
<br>
“It was my own doing,” the Dark Elf interrupted, turning to address the druid.  “I chose to return to Neriak, arrogantly believing I was too important for them to refuse me.  I should have known better.  What I did was stupid and foolish, and you are not to blame for my idiocy.”<br>
<br>
“Yes I am,” Laera argued heatedly.  “If I hadn’t turned my back like a selfish coward, you would never have returned!”<br>
<br>
“It was my actions that made you leave.”<br>
<br>
“But, if I-“<br>
<br>
“Listen to me!”  Dreketh snapped, reaching out to take the Wood Elf by the arms.  “We can sit here going back and forth for hours and end up tracing the blame all the way back to the gods before we’re done.  Now, the truth is, I don’t blame you for what happened.  I used to.  After you left, I swore my vengeance upon your blood, but I have since been made to recognize the depth of that mistake.”<br>
<br>
Laera pressed her lips together, refusing to look at the Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
“Think what you will,” Dreketh continued, her voice breaking slightly.  “But your coming back has saved me.”<br>
<br>
“There are any number of ways you could survive out here,” the Wood Elf replied sullenly.<br>
<br>
“I wasn’t talking about my life.”<br>
<br>
Laera raised her eyes to meet Dreketh’s, questioning the Dark Elf’s meaning.<br>
<br>
“Because of you, I have been given a second chance to fulfill the wishes of my god.  You are the only person on Norrath who can do that, and it means so much to me, I can never put it into proper words,” the shadow knight said evenly, her gaze gravely serious.  “Thank you.”<br>
<br>
Laera stared at the shadow knight’s battered face, seeing no sign of deceit or trickery.  Dreketh meant every word she said.  The Wood Elf had no idea how to respond.  She had gone from expecting to defend herself to being thanked by the Teir’Dal she had wronged.<br>
<br>
“Come,” she said.  Laera saw by the Dark Elf’s ashen color that she had reached her limits of endurance.  “You need your rest and I can’t do anything more without a wash basin.”<br>
<br>
“Where are we going?” Dreketh asked weakly, with visible pallor on her face.  “The innkeepers out here hate the Teir’Dal.”<br>
<br>
“Then we’ll rent one of the empty houses for a couple of weeks.  What they don’t know won’t hurt them, especially in your condition,” Laera said, pulling one of Dreketh’s arms around her neck to support the Dark Elf.  Together, the two young women stood precariously.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be fine,” Dreketh said, clenching her teeth against the pain.  “Just cauterize the wounds and we’ll get out of here.”<br>
<br>
“You’re not going anywhere without rest,” Laera said darkly.  “I’m the closest thing we have to a healer.  So, unless you think you can take me down in combat right now, we’re sticking around until you’re back on your feet.  You got that?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh rolled her eyes with a sneer.  “By all the gods, I hate you,” she muttered.<br>
<br>
“I know,” the Wood Elf replied, her grin hidden from view.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“Now I know why you got this place for ten platinum,” Dreketh said wearily as Laera picked up the washbowl filled with rainwater sitting on the nightstand.<br>
<br>
“It’s better than sleeping outside,” the Wood Elf said over her shoulder.  Opening the door, she tossed the water onto the doorsteps.<br>
<br>
“I thought you liked the rain?”<br>
<br>
“Let’s just say it got real old, real fast,” Laera replied caustically, wiping the nightstand dry with a rag before replacing the bowl.  Small metallic sounds echoed around the room as droplets leaking from the ceiling struck the tin container.<br>
<br>
The house was, in a word, dismal.  At first, they were elated that they had any place to stay at all.  Then night fell, and it soon became apparent how inadequate Commonland architecture really was.  Not only did the roof leak at the slightest drizzle, but also an unpleasant breeze flowed continuously from the ill-fitted door and windows in the one-room abode.  Though trivial during the temperate daytime hours, the constant airflow made for some chilling nights.  The floorboards squeaked, the paint was cracked, the single twin bed was sagging and uncomfortable, and the young women soon discovered how a wide variety of insect life had long ago decided to make the woodwork their permanent home.<br>
<br>
In the end, however, Laera’s statement turned out to be true – it really was better than sleeping outside.  The stone and mortar fireplace provided some degree of mild warmth and there was a roof over their heads – precarious though it may be.  At the very least, it kept the elements and wild animals at bay, allowing the shadow knight the time she needed to recuperate naturally.<br>
<br>
Sitting down at the edge of the creaky bed, Laera made a precursory examination of the Dark Elf’s cuts and bruises.  “How are you feeling this morning?  Sleep okay?”<br>
<br>
“I’ve had better nights,” Dreketh replied evenly, succumbing to the druid’s inspection of her arms, legs and face.  “But I feel better than yesterday.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked at her companion with concern.  Dreketh’s nightmares were getting worse with each passing night.  Laera would often wake to the sound of her companion muttering in her sleep, but she could never make out any of the words.  As much as the druid tried to get Dreketh to talk about the dreams, the Dark Elf adamantly refused.  <br>
<br>
“At least the swelling on your mouth has gone down quite a bit.”  Laera eyed Dreketh’s face closely.  “I don’t know what you were hit with, but it must have nearly taken your head off.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh touched the tender cheek gingerly with the back of her hand.  “It was the gauntlet of an overenthusiastic captain,” she said, her words bitter at the memory.<br>
<br>
“I could heal that, you know…”<br>
<br>
“Just… leave it, all right?”<br>
<br>
“Hey, it’s fine by me if you prefer being miserable,” Laera shrugged.  “Now turn over, I have to check your back.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh groaned, but complied obediently, having long ago resigned herself to the druid’s militant bedside manner.  “I don’t know what was worse,” she grumbled as Laera inspected the scorch marks left by the cauterization.  “Being stretched out on the slab, or having you burn me to a cinder on that iron skewer.”<br>
<br>
“Just following the Neriak Guide to Happier Sadism like you taught me,” Laera replied, her voice deliberately flippant.  “How does it feel?  Has the burning stopped?”<br>
<br>
“A little,” Dreketh replied with a wince.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf nodded, finishing her examination.  “Well, you’re coming along, but I think I’m going to see about extending our stay another week.”<br>
<br>
“That’s absurd,” the Dark Elf shot back.  “I’ll be fine in a couple of days and we can start heading to Freeport.”<br>
<br>
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Laera replied.  “You can’t walk more than ten feet without my help.  It’s a sheer miracle you made it from Neriak to the tunnel by yourself.  If anything happens to us out there with you in this condition, we wouldn’t even be able to get away, much less put up a decent fight.”<br>
<br>
“And what do you plan on using for money?  We’re nearly broke, and it’s not likely that slumlord Human is going to let you stay here for free.”<br>
<br>
“Just relax about that.  I’ve made special arrangements and I’m handling it with the innkeeper,” the Wood Elf assured.<br>
<br>
Dreketh slowly turned a glowering look on her companion’s glibness. “You’re handling it with him?”<br>
<br>
Laera nodded.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight wearily rolled her eyes closed.  “So help me, Wood Elf.  After everything I’ve done, if you’ve gone and-“<br>
<br>
“Relax, relax.  I’m just hunting wild game and selling the meat to him for use in his kitchen.  That’s all.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s sullen, disbelieving eyes shot daggers at the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
“Really, I’m serious!”  Laera held her hands out openly.  “Your valiant efforts in protecting my virtue have not been in vain, I swear it on Tunare’s feet.”<br>
<br>
“I didn’t think you druids hunted wild game for food,” Dreketh said.<br>
<br>
“We don’t mourn the loss of creatures whose purpose in life is the sustenance of others.” <br>
<br>
“Mmm hmm.  Tell that to the Ogre who’s about to eat you,” the shadow knight replied, cringing slightly as she leaned back in her bed.  <br>
<br>
“Now get some rest,” the druid ordered her patient, dismissing the last comment.  “I have work to do if we’re going to earn our keep.  Are you going to be okay if I leave for a few hours?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh nodded, rubbing her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Do you need anything before I go?”<br>
<br>
“I’m injured, not an invalid,” Dreketh commented dryly.<br>
<br>
“All right, fine,” Laera said, backing off from her “mother hen” persona, as the Dark Elf called it.  “Just try to get some sleep.  You need it to heal.  There’s water in the packs if you get thirsty.”  Without further comment, the Wood Elf left, gently closing the door and bolting it behind her as she went.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf sneered her repugnance at the notion of sleep, though in reality she was exhausted from her insomnia the previous night.  Every time she closed her eyes, visions of her ordeal in Neriak haunted her as a hideous reminder of lessons learned.  She didn’t know if it was just her own mind playing tricks on her, or if Innoruuk seriously wished to the drive her punishment home with his unyielding hammer.  <br>
<br>
Whatever the case, she prayed fervently for it to stop.  The last time dreams affected her in this way was many long years ago when she was a young girl.  Xon Quexill would often stay up all night watching over her as she slept – especially during the difficult days following the death of her parents.  Whether it truly helped keep the dreams away or not, Dreketh couldn’t recall for certain.  What she did remember was that it made her feel a whole lot better at the time, having him look out for her.<br>
<br>
“Master Xon,” she whispered to the silence, fighting to keep her eyelids open.  “You were always there when I needed you.  Where are you now?”<br>
<br>
Though the shadow knight put up a heroic struggle to stay awake, eventually the lulling shroud of sleep won out.  Dreketh’s last conscious thoughts were those of her adopted father as she imagined him sitting in the chair next to her bed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill marched alone toward the Temple of Innoruuk with a furious stride, the enraged flame of Innoruuk’s hatred burning in his gaze.  Though thousands of issues were pulling him in every possible direction, only one man’s image was reflected in the guild master’s eyes.<br>
<br>
“Kella N’Threk,” he said in a cool, dangerous tone as one of the temple guards approached.<br>
<br>
The guard spoke from within the confines of his helm.  “Priest N’Threk is indisposed, sire, and cannot-“<br>
<br>
“I don’t care if the priest is in divine audience with Innoruuk Himself.  You will take me to Kella N’Threk, or by my hand I will tear this temple apart stone by stone until I locate him.”  The necromancer’s tone was seething, leaving no doubt to his intentions.  Reaching into the folds of his magenta robes, Quexill pulled forth a rolled-up scroll.  “This is a writ conscripted by the conclave of guild masters demanding that priest N’Threk’s declaration of Tal’Shyen be revoked immediately.  You will find my name placed first among the list of signatures.”<br>
<br>
The guard accepted the scroll and, unrolling it, skimmed over the texts it contained.  Satisfied of its authenticity, the guard placed it under one arm and saluted the master necromancer with respect.<br>
<br>
“Very well, sire,” he said dutifully, as if having been forewarned that the necromancer and the document were forthcoming.  “The writ will be delivered immediately.  Please follow me to priest N’Threk’s chambers, sir.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“Xon Quexill, master of the necromancer guild, requests an audience, your grace,” the guard spoke, acting as herald by announcing the guild master’s arrival to Kella N’Threk’s chambers.<br>
<br>
“Let him enter,” came the priest’s nearly inaudible response.  Were it not for the faultlessly silent halls of the temple, the old man’s decrepit voice would not have been heard at all.<br>
<br>
Stepping aside, the guard gestured for Xon Quexill to enter through the open doorway.  The necromancer stepped silently into the priest’s chambers, his scathing eyes going immediately toward Kella N’Threk lying in the meager bed across the room.  <br>
<br>
With a small flourish of his hand, the priest dismissed the temple guard.  The chamber was now empty, save for he and the glaring guild master.<br>
<br>
“You heard, did you?” the priest’s quivering voice spoke.  “I knew it would not be long before I had the honor of your presence once again, my friend.  Though I admit, I did not anticipate your arrival so soon.  I would think your duties would have been enough to waylay the news for at least a month.”<br>
<br>
The necromancer stood motionless near the door, his nostrils flaring.  Though no word escaped his lips, his fury was palpable in the small room.<br>
<br>
“A dreadful pity the nexus foolishly chose to return to Neriak,” Kella N’Threk continued, baiting his visitor.  “I hear the sounds of her torment echoed loudly throughout the Lodge of the Dead well into the morning hours before she was properly adjusted.”<br>
<br>
“Adjusted?” Quexill replied coldly.  “Adjusted!” he repeated, losing what tenuous grasp he had on his temper.  Treading quickly across the chamber floor, the necromancer grasped the ailing priest by his bedclothes, yanking him from off the mattress by several inches.  “Your doddering holiness ordered the torture of one of Innoruuk’s chosen!  You twisted and sundered her, body and soul!  You violated her!  You humiliated her!  But your greatest mistake was that of choosing my daughter to do it to!”<br>
<br>
“She is no more your daughter than I am a dragon, necromancer,” Kella N’Threk said in a surprisingly collective voice, being the object of the guild master’s ire as he was.  <br>
<br>
“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t end your life right now, you sanctimonious son of a bitch!” Quexill yelled in the blind priest’s face.<br>
<br>
“You may do so at your leisure, necromancer,” N’Threk replied, retaining his calm demeanor in the face of death.  “I have given my final order as custodian of the Pact, and all is in readiness for when the unsealing takes place.  Only time stands now between Innoruuk and deliverance from years of injustice by His enemies.  Because of our efforts – you and I – the Teir’Dal will inevitably make the claim to the Chalice once it is unearthed and Innoruuk will become the one, true god.  Nothing, not even my death, can alter this fact, my friend.”<br>
<br>
“Call me that one more time and you will wish it was you on the slab, priest,” Quexill warned.<br>
<br>
“Do with me as you will,” Kella N’Threk said wearily.  “My work on this world is complete, and my life’s end comes closer with every breath I take.  One day soon I will rest knowing that I have done all I could to serve our Father.  That is all any Teir’Dal can wish for, Xon Quexill.  The nexus-”<br>
<br>
“Her name is Dreketh!” the necromancer yelled angrily, hurling the old priest back down onto the bed.  “She is the daughter of a once proud and loyal house of the Teir’Dal bloodline – a house that is now extinct save for her!”<br>
<br>
“Loyal house?” the priest asked in a slithering voice.  “You seem so certain of what you say – all because of one surviving girl-child you have come to cherish.  Jumping to conclusions is hardly a ringing endorsement of your leadership skills, guild master.  If I were you, I would be very careful – very careful, indeed – about whom I choose to pledge my allegiances.  You know as well as I what must happen for the Pact of Zeranon to come to fruition.”<br>
<br>
Halting in his tirade, Xon Quexill listened closely to the failing priest’s words, only partially comprehending their meaning.  “What are you saying?” he asked, his words slow and dire.<br>
<br>
Kella N’Threk grinned evilly, a sight few saw due to the priest’s preferred manner of subtlety.  “I’m saying there was one reason and one reason only your so-called ‘daughter’ was selected for the Pact.  It was in her blood from the day she was born, making her the ideal candidate above all others.”<br>
<br>
Thoughts raced through the necromancer’s mind as he assimilated the priest’s words and their import.  Quexill mentally began putting together the pieces of what he knew about Dreketh’s family and the Pact of Zeranon, meshing together in a convoluted jigsaw.  As far as he could see, every avenue of meaning behind N’Threk’s riddle stopped at a dead end.  All, that is, except for one, and that final avenue pointed to a conclusion so unimaginable, yet made so much sense, Quexill doubted his own sanity in the face of the mad priest’s words.<br>
<br>
“Who selected her for the Pact?” he asked quietly, repeating the question he asked of the priest months ago when this whole carnival began.<br>
<br>
The priest grinned again, his milky eyes gleaming white in the room’s soft light.<br>
<br>
“Damn you, tell me!” the master necromancer shouted insistently.<br>
<br>
His grin unwavering, Kella N’Threk answered.<br>
<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 17 - Waking Nightmares</c><br>
<br>
Laera woke with a start at hearing Dreketh’s grievous cries for the third night in a row.  Tossing her covers aside, the Wood Elf scrambled to kneel on the hard, makeshift cot she made on the floor next to the bed.  With firm hands, Laera attended the distressed Dark Elf, calming her as she called out into the night.<br>
<br>
“I’m right here, Dreketh.  I’m not going anywhere, it’s all right,” she whispered to her sleeping companion. By now, she knew what words worked best to dismiss the shadow knight’s tortured dreams.  <br>
<br>
Though Dreketh had long ago managed to compose herself while awake, she grew increasingly distressed at the visions that pursued her while asleep.  The words she had once mumbled days ago turned into tortured cries – usually pleas for mercy or calling for the Wood Elf in a panic.  Once in a while, the druid’s ministrations would wake the flailing Teir’Dal, causing her to fully recognize Laera in her fevered throes.  Once she saw that her companion was truly there by her side, Dreketh would collapse into the Wood Elf’s arms wracked with sobs until she literally cried herself back to sleep.<br>
<br>
Inevitably, morning would arrive and the Dark Elf would always stalwartly refuse to discuss her dreams.  Laera could only surmise what embarrassment such a weakness would cause a Teir’Dal in the face of a peer, and so never pressed Dreketh into talking about anything she didn’t wish to.  <br>
<br>
This night was the worst so far.  Tossing about in the entangling sheets, Dreketh wailed fevered pleas for forgiveness.  She called out to Laera as if over a great distance, begging for her to return.  The Wood Elf tried her best to suppress the strong Dark Elf’s thrashing, fearing that she might re-injure her wounds.  All the while, she whispered her assurances that she was there and wasn’t going anywhere.<br>
<br>
At long last, Dreketh’s throes subsided without her waking, much to Laera’s relief.  It was always easier when Dreketh didn’t wake up, allowing Laera the liberty of a few precious moments of additional rest.  The combined efforts of caring for the Dark Elf at night while trying to earn their stay during the daytime had taken its toll on the young Wood Elf.  She fancied herself a morning person, for the most part, but it seemed lately that she had been meeting the rising sun with increasing angst.<br>
<br>
Sighing her devout thanks for this blessing, she carefully smoothed out the Dark Elf’s entangled bed sheets.  She tucked the disheveled blanket back under Dreketh’s chin with the utmost care, and sternly reminded herself that this certainly wasn’t a picnic for her dark companion either.<br>
<br>
The full moon’s light shown through the window to fall on the now calm and slumbering Teir’Dal face.  Distorted as it was by streaks of rainwater running down the glass, the pale moonlight had the uncanny effect of creating tears rolling down the Dark Elf’s placid cheeks.  Laera thought how appropriate the illusion was for Dreketh’s plight.  <br>
<br>
Risking the chance of waking her companion, Laera reached out a finger to gently brush aside a single strand of white hair from Dreketh’s forehead.  Mystified, she watched as the Dark Elf’s “tears” began pouring down the back of her own hand.  Months ago, before all this began, she wouldn’t have dreamt of even touching the blue skin of a Teir’Dal.  Yet here she was, nurturing one as she would a dear friend or relative – all because of the Pact.<br>
<br>
Satisfied that the Dark Elf was finally settled, Laera lay back down on the floor.  Unable to fall immediately back to sleep, she listened to the steady sound of the water hitting the roof.  She listened to the rhythmic sound of water dripping into the bowl on the nightstand nearby.  All else was silent, as no lightning flashed among the hills of the East Commonlands this night.  That was plenty fine by her.  It seemed Karana, god of the storm, decided to keep it to a dull roar for once.  Tonight presented nothing more than sparse clusters of thunderheads rolling across the sky as they dropped their meager load of rain.<br>
<br>
Eerily in tune with the Wood Elf’s train of thought, one of those clouds moved to obscure the moonlight from the window, causing the room to fall into blackness.  Everything darkened all around, depriving Laera of her sight except for the slight, red glow of Dreketh on the bed above.  Strangely, Laera didn’t find this event too settling.  She normally would welcome the coming of the dark, as it helped encourage what precious little sleep she could get in the course of the night.<br>
<br>
Not this darkness.  Instead of being comforted, Laera felt stifled and strangled.  The feeling became so intense – so invasive and overwhelming – the Wood Elf sat bolt upright, scanning the small one-room house for the intruder every fiber of her being said was there.  Laera’s keen Elven eyes, however, insisted the room was empty, save for herself and Dreketh.<br>
<br>
Glaring around at the walls of the room, as if silently warning off some invisible assailant, the Wood Elf lay back down slowly, her head returning to rest on the soft pillow.  <br>
<br>
This is ridiculous, she thought, clutching her blanket to her chest.  What was wrong with her?  She hadn’t been afraid of the dark since she was a child!  The stress of her situation combined with severe lack of sleep must have been playing tricks on her mind.  Closing her eyes, she tried again to go back to sleep.<br>
<br>
As her mind drifted with the onset of slumber, she began to hear the familiar voices of her subconscious mind as they fired away amongst themselves with random phrases she could only partially hear.  The longer she dozed, however, the louder and more distinct the voices became, the words they spoke becoming more and more coherent.  <br>
<br>
Restive and complacent, Laera listened to the words as she would a lullaby.  Though they made perfect sense to her now in this dark and protected place of her mind, she knew once she awoke and returned to reality, she wouldn’t remember the words nor would she be able to repeat them even if she did.  The words were all meaning and no language.  They were her own thoughts in their purest form that no spoken phrase could justly portray.<br>
<br>
No, that wasn’t right.  There was one word that became accentuated whenever the voices spoke it.  Fear.  The word caused the placid symphony of her mind to strike a sour chord every tenth note, making the Wood Elf cringe at the sound of it.  Soon, all the voices began speaking the word in unison, causing every note to become sour.<br>
<br>
Fear.  Fear.  Fear.<br>
<br>
The word was more than language, for language was interpreted by the mind.  Casual listeners were easily able to remove themselves from its frightening portents when heard aloud.  Not so with the purity of one’s own mind.  The faultless, immaculate meaning of the word entered her soul with each beating of her heart.<br>
<br>
Fear!  Fear!  Fear!<br>
<br>
The orchestra of Laera’s subconscious struck every note with increasing ardor – the words that were not words echoing through her head in a terrifying cacophony.<br>
<br>
Fear!  Fear!  Fear! <br>
<br>
Thoughts became reality, and the Wood Elf’s eyes flared open.  The darkness of the house remained, only now it had become alive, suffused with the unseen presence she had felt before.  There was no longer any doubt – they were not alone.<br>
<br>
Turning her head to see if Dreketh was awake, Laera felt a cold, wet sensation on her cheek.  Idly assuming she had probably drooled in her sleep again, she raised a hand to toss the flaccid pillow needlessly aside.  <br>
<br>
That was when she first noticed it.  Lying so still in her sleep, she hadn’t felt it before.  But as her forearm rose, she suddenly felt a thick, gooey substance resisting her movement.<br>
<br>
Laera looked down to inspect her arm, finding it dripping with black, tar-like ooze that was unusually cold to the touch.  Glancing around the room, the moon’s newly reemerging light revealed that the floor was covered wall to wall with the viscous fluid.  A heavy, tingling sensation gripped her chest with the realization that she had, in fact, been sleeping in this shallow pool of ooze on the floor.  <br>
<br>
Her breaths started coming in gasps.  Her own lungs fought her as she tried frantically to call out -- first a whimper, then a moan, then a cry.  With every rapid breath she took, her voice rose until it became a forced scream as she watched the substance drip gruesomely from her arm to the ground.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s scream woke Dreketh with a start.  The Dark Elf’s head pounded, as usual, but the warrior’s instinct with which she was trained took over at the sound of danger.<br>
<br>
“What!  What is it!” the shadow knight called, her eyes darting here and there to seek out any clear and present danger.  Her night vision brought the room into perfect clarity, but she could see no creature about.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh!” Laera’s voice rose with panic.  <br>
<br>
Sitting up to look over the edge of her bed, the Dark Elf could now make out the black sea of ooze covering every inch of the floor.  “Innoruuk’s hate, what is that!”<br>
<br>
“It’s all over me!” Laera cried as she scrambled to stand.  Though the fluid didn’t pin her to the ground by any supernatural force, she did find it difficult to attain a good footing in the thick, slippery substance.<br>
<br>
Dreketh reached out her hand.  “Here, climb onto the bed,” she said urgently, gritting her teeth as Laera grabbed hold.  Her injuries flared painfully under the stress of the Wood Elf’s weight.<br>
<br>
Once her companion climbed safely on the bed next to her, the Dark Elf examined the smudges of ooze left on her hand and wrist from the druid’s touch.  “What is this…?” she demanded.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know!  It’s evil!” was all Laera could say as she violently shook her arm, trying to eradicate the sticky substance.  Looking down at her cot on the floor where she had lain only moments ago, she saw the black ooze begin to engulf the pillow and covers.  “It’s getting deeper!” she said, her eyes wide.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s gaze narrowed as she looked around the floor, mystified at the subtle movements stirring about in the growing pool.  In all her days of study as a necromancer, she had never seen anything like this.  The ooze continued to rise steadily, apparently seeping in from beneath the floorboards.  She could feel a furtive tremor pass through the mattress beneath her, causing the walls to shudder frighteningly around them.<br>
<br>
“Whatever it is, it won’t be long before it reaches us up here,” the Dark Elf said darkly.  Without thinking, the Dark Elf reached up to grab their packs dangling from a hook on the wall nearby.  Before she managed to so much as touch their belongings, she gasped and drew back her arm, favoring it.  <br>
<br>
Laera immediately forgot about her own struggle with the ooze and bounced across the bed to check the injuries on her companion’s shoulder.  Pulling back the Dark Elf’s red halter-top, she discovered that the cauterizations were still intact well enough.  Nevertheless, it was clear that the shoulder was still causing her companion a great deal of pain.  By her hurried examination, the only thing Laera could guess was that Dreketh’s helping her onto the bed placed too much strain in the wrong place on the Dark Elf’s arm.<br>
<br>
“Does it hurt, shadow knight?” came a deep voice emanating from the rising ooze.  Dreketh’s confused look at hearing the disembodied voice vanished as she doubled over with a cry, clutching her shoulder tightly with her other hand.  “How about now?”<br>
<br>
“Dreketh!” Laera cried, grabbing hold of the paralyzed shadow knight.  “What is it!  What’s happening!”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf could only cry out in pain until her lungs were emptied of air.  Ducking her head, Dreketh’s mouth remained open as her scream continued silently.<br>
<br>
Not knowing what to do, Laera sprang to the edge of the bed to shout over its edge at the presumably sentient tar pit below.  “Stop it!  I demand it in the name of Tunare!  Stop it now!”<br>
<br>
The black ooze shot forth in a gushing wave at the Wood Elf’s words, striking her squarely in the throat.  With a muffled shriek, Laera was pushed from off the bed to strike the wall behind her, an ooze tentacle pinning her there solidly by the neck.  <br>
<br>
“Tunare is a bit busy attending other issues at the moment, I’m afraid,” the voice bellowed from below in mock concern.  <br>
<br>
“Who are you?” The Wood Elf asked in a strangled voice, pulling impotently against the tentacle with her fingernails.  Dangling several feet off the floor, her legs kicked about in her struggles to free herself..<br>
<br>
“I am the one who has gone to considerable lengths to locate you – both of you,” the voice replied.  “Yet here I find the advocates of the Pact licking their wounds off in some backwater corner of this world.  How pathetic – disappointing, even.  It will be my pleasure to bring an end to the threat you pose to all things here and now.”<br>
<br>
Without so much as a squeal, Laera felt the ooze collapse around her windpipe, cutting off all gasps for air that she made.  The sound of Dreketh’s cries filled her ears along with the frantic pounding of her own heart, as her struggles became the violent thrashings of survival.  Stars began to flash before her eyes, and she knew it would not be long before she lost consciousness.<br>
<br>
The furious beating of Laera’s heart grew louder in her ears until finally she realized that what she was hearing wasn’t her heart at all, but a vehement pounding against the door.  She opened her eyes just in time to see it shatter into splinters, the various pieces falling to land in the ooze with heavy, thudding sounds.<br>
<br>
“Cazic-Thule!”<br>
<br>
In the doorway stood the ranger, crossbow held at the ready.  Without pause, he let loose a bolt that struck the tentacle midway between the rolling black pool below and the helpless Wood Elf pinned above.  Laera felt the tentacle’s grip go instantly slack around her neck, causing her to fall on all fours into the ooze with a heavy splash.<br>
<br>
“Ah, our sheep dog has returned to rescue his favorite flock,” the voice intoned.  The tentacle disappeared back into the pool, taking the lodged crossbow bolt with it.  “Have you no concept of your goddess’s will?  I doubt She would take kindly to you thwarting Her designs in keeping safe the Cup of Ages.”<br>
<br>
“Is the god of terror to be the god of ignorance as well?” the ranger barked his defiant words.  “Waste not my time with useless banter!  Send forth your true minion, coward, and I will defeat it as surely as I have the sycophant of Bertoxxulous!”<br>
<br>
The sepulchral laughter of Cazic-Thule emitted from the roiling depths of the ooze.  The oily slick bulged ominously as the ranger’s demand was aptly met by the god he mocked<br>
<br>
Rising forth was the gruesome head of an enormous serpent.  Scaled black as pitch, the fearsome creature arched menacingly over the ranger standing in the entrance, its head nearly touching the vaulted ceiling above.  The normally sticky and cumbersome ooze rolled off the serpent like water from a duck’s back, rapidly cascading down the gleaming scales in mystifying droplets.  Two blood red eyes aimed their loathsome gaze at the ranger, speaking their message of doom in a silent voice of warning.  <br>
<br>
The Wood Elf druid looked up from where she sat on the floor to see the undaunted ranger tossing the spent crossbow aside.   With grim threat in his eyes as he peered out from beneath his wide-brimmed hat, he drew his rapier from the scabbard at his hip.  The sight of the ranger’s calm, defiant mien made it seem as though it was the serpent who was about to be victimized, and not vice versa.<br>
<br>
Another tentacle shot out of the ooze again, streaming toward the ranger.  Ducking to a crouch, he swung the razor sharp foil above his head, effectively slicing the tentacle in two.  The severed portion fell to the ground in a useless puddle behind him.  Another tentacle shot out, which the ranger evaded with an agile tuck and roll to stand ready once more.<br>
<br>
“Grab your things and get out!” he shouted to the two women inside.  More tentacles emerged to entangle him in their grasp.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh is hurt!  She can’t go anywhere!”  Laera called back, her voice panicked.<br>
<br>
Leaping backward, the ranger evaded each successive attack with astonishing feats of agility.  Whenever possible, he sliced off another tentacle only to have it replaced by one or two more.  It soon became apparent that these tactics were not going to last for long before he was overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
“I can’t keep this up!” he yelled.  “Escape now or we all die!”<br>
<br>
Laera heard the distinct tinge of alarm in the ranger’s voice as he fought.  It was true, the ranger was holding his own for now, but even she could see he was quickly tiring from the maneuvers he was forced to make in his skirmish  <br>
<br>
Still sitting on the floor – up to her shoulders in the sinister ooze – Laera fought to ward off the overpowering feeling of despair surrounding her.  Evil was everywhere.  Looking about, she saw it saturate everything  -- the walls, the furniture.  Quite literally, she was sitting in the middle of it, wallowing through it as one wallowed in quicksand.  There was no longer any point in trying to rid herself of the black substance, as it now covered nearly every inch of her from head to toe.  She could feel it creep its way through her clothing, penetrating the fabric to press against her skin with its hideous, cold touch.  <br>
<br>
She felt like giving up and allowing it to rise above her head to engulf her fully, bringing a final end to her futile struggles.  With every push she gave in life, something invariably pushed back with equal force, keeping her stalemated.  She came to realize that The Pact of Zeranon was not the glorious, heroic quest she once imagined it would be.  Instead, it was a series of grueling trials Tunare placed upon her, one after another, to see how long it took before Her faithful servant collapsed under the pressure.  <br>
<br>
The more she learned about the Pact, the more suspect the motives of her goddess became.  For the first time in her life, the druid questioned her own divine convictions.  What was to happen once the Chalice was discovered?  At one time, she would have had faith enough to personally hand the Chalice over to her goddess.  She would have trusted blindly that its power would champion the causes of light in the hands of Tunare – she still did.<br>
<br>
But the specifics of those causes now stared Laera in the face.  Looking over, the Wood Elf saw Dreketh lying prone on the bed, the Dark Elf having lost consciousness from the pain Cazic-Thule inflicted.  Laera knew with a certainty that such causes of light would spell the extinction of all Teir’Dal.  As a twisted and perverted mockery of the Elven form, spawned by the Prince of Hate Himself, the Dark Elf race was considered an abomination to life, and must be expulsed from Norrath – so she had been taught all her life.<br>
<br>
Now a Dark Elf was her trusted companion – someone she was sworn to shelter and protect at the cost of her own life.  At the behest of Tunare Herself, Laera had come to see in Dreketh a myriad of things she considered forever alien to her blood enemy.  Integrity, candor, honesty, loyalty, and even an odd sense of honor all have been portrayed in her companion at one point or another over the past months.  Once the Teir’Dal were driven from Norrath, what would happen to those traits?  What would become of Dreketh?<br>
<br>
Looking at her companion, Laera realized Dreketh needed her now more than ever – the same companion she had nurtured and cared for.  Over the past couple of weeks, Laera had served as the shadow knight’s guardian, slaving to nurse the Dark Elf back to health day by day.<br>
<br>
And now Cazic-Thule sought to end it all as the ooze rose steadily higher, threatening to engulf them both.  No, the Wood Elf said to herself.  She would be damned before she allowed anyone under her care to fall victim to such a fate.  <br>
<br>
Taking a deep breath, the druid forced her legs to move beneath the vile substance that had, by this time, risen to her chin.  With grim determination, Laera pushed against the oppressive force all around her, stating her defiance of this wicked and contemptible god.  She would deal with Tunare and the Pact another time.  Right now, she had more important things to attend to.<br>
<br>
She stood tall, the viscous ooze dripping from her limbs like tar.  Though the pool still reached the middle of her thighs, the Wood Elf traipsed over to the bed and grabbed hold of their packs hanging on the wall to sling them over her shoulder.  Sliding one hand beneath Dreketh’s knees and the other behind her back, Laera hefted her companion up off the bed and headed toward the door.<br>
<br>
“Duck!”  The word wafted its way through the druid’s mind just in time for her to react.  Turning to face the wall, Laera protected herself and Dreketh from the ensuing blast of fire that impacted the serpent.<br>
<br>
“Through the door!  Now!”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf was quick to obey the ranger’s words.  With as much speed as the clinging ooze would allow, Laera bullied her way out of the beaten, ooze-splattered exit.  Once outside, she could see by the moonlight remnants of the ranger’s battle strewn across the muddy grass.  Puddles of the black fluid littered the ground, mingling with the red of blood.<br>
<br>
A rough hand yanked her free of the house and its malevolent occupant.  Holding tight to Dreketh, Laera stumbled a bit, but caught her footing.  Turning, she saw another tentacle reaching out for her that was quickly severed by the ranger’s swift weapon.<br>
<br>
“Move!  Move!” came the ranger’s voice, accompanied by a brutal shove against her back.  <br>
<br>
The Wood Elf didn’t look back.  With all their might, Laera’s legs pumped against the ground, placing as much distance between her and Cazic-Thule’s reptilian beast as possible.  Her breaths came in gasps, and the cool night air filled her lungs with its excruciating touch.  Every breath she took intensified the burning pain in her chest, but she dared not relent for fear of being caught, once again, in that pool of ooze.<br>
<br>
The ground came up to meet her.  Her legs had given out, causing the Wood Elf to pitch forward into the wet, slippery landscape.  Before her panic-muddled mind could determine that anything was wrong, she found herself sprawled on the ground, looking up at Dreketh lying in the mud ahead where she had dropped her.  <br>
<br>
Though dazed, the sudden fall was enough to bring the Dark Elf out of oblivion to look around herself, confused.  “What… what happened?”<br>
<br>
“Get up,” Laera cried urgently, scrambling to her own feet and helping the Dark Elf to stand.  “If we don’t get out of here, we’ll be-“<br>
<br>
A hand on her shoulder halted the Wood Elf’s panicked words.  Turning around, Laera found the ranger standing behind her, his eyes looking at her calmly from beneath his hat.  Though winded from his own exertions, the ranger spoke to her in a smooth, collected voice.<br>
<br>
“Relax, druid of Tunare,” he said, pausing to catch his breath.  “We are far enough away from Cazic-Thule’s minion.”<br>
<br>
“It… can’t be… far behind,” Laera argued between gasps.<br>
<br>
“As I said, relax,” the ranger repeated sternly.  “The tar snake is a creature spawned by the hand of Cazic-Thule, but it remains unable to travel this plane beyond its native ooze.  You and your companion are safe for now.”<br>
<br>
Above the ranger’s quiet words, Laera could hear the shrieking cries of the serpent coming from the house in the distance.  Judging by the hills and foliage she could see behind her, Laera estimated that she must have run at least two hundred yards through mud and falling rain to land where she did.<br>
<br>
“I-… I ran… that far?” she gasped.  “It was only… a moment…”<br>
<br>
“My word to Marr, I have never seen anyone run so fast in my life,” the ranger swore his devout oath.  “I was hard-pressed to keep up with you once you took off.”<br>
<br>
“I was… I-…Dreketh!”  Laera whirled back around, her face filled with concern for the Dark Elf she had so unceremoniously dropped onto the ground.<br>
<br>
“I’m okay,” came the Teir’Dal’s sullen voice.  “It feels like every bone in my body is broken, but I’ll live.”  The Dark Elf blinked, looking up at the ranger standing next to Laera.  “You come to our aid yet again, friend.  Thank you.”  <br>
<br>
Though her words were curt and abrupt, the depth of Dreketh’s sincerity was not lost on her audience, who nodded once slowly, accepting her gratitude in silence.<br>
<br>
Sighing in relief, Laera collapsed to the ground once again and whispered a word of devout thanks.  This time, however, her words were not directed toward her goddess.  Somehow it didn’t feel right this time…<br>
<br>
Instead of dwelling on this twinge of conscience, Laera lowered her head to the ground, exhausted from her flight.  Through the steady sound of the falling rain, the continued screeching of Cazic-Thule’s serpent rang through the trees and hills of the Commonlands.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The remainder of the night passed uneventfully as the ranger stood watch over the companions’ impromptu camp.  Bouts of light rainfall crossed their way like spirits in the night across the Commonlands, but the storms never amounted to much.  Eventually the serpent of Cazic-Thule lost impetus, its distant cries of frustration growing ever weaker as the minion’s power to survive in the world of Norrath dwindled.<br>
<br>
Silence ruled supreme at the break of dawn, save for the stirrings of small creatures as they began their usual morning routines.  Birds greeted the sun with their songs amid the treetops.  Ever vigilant, as he was throughout the night, the ranger sat upon a large boulder watching the sun’s ascent to the east.  Streaking sunlight penetrated the towering trees all about, causing pale shafts of yellow light to suffuse the vegetation surrounding him.<br>
<br>
Taking in a deep breath, the ranger had to admit that for all of Shalyndrial’s fanciful musings, she certainly had a point about dawn’s light.  It was most unusual for an enchantress, of all people, to appreciate the splendor and glory of nature’s creations.  Usually that remained the territory of the druid and ranger – not some book-reading recluse who spends her time studying in musty libraries.<br>
<br>
Turning his head slightly, the ranger listened to the companions rousing from their sleep.  Surprisingly, there were few sounds of bickering coming from the camp behind him, as the young women went about their preparations to break camp.  The familiar scent of boiled taro root wafted its way to the ranger’s nose, taking him back to his early days of adventure when he had made the very same dish for breakfast.  He smiled nostalgically at the memory of having to stomach that bitter-tasting plant when there was nothing else around to forage.<br>
<br>
A rustling in the leaves on the ground alerted the ranger to someone’s approach – probably the druid.  Returning his gaze to the sunrise before him, he adjusted the brim of his hat to rest lower over his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Um… excuse me?” came Laera’s timid voice from several feet behind him.<br>
<br>
The ranger made no response, nor did he make any sign he was about to.<br>
<br>
“We’re fixing some breakfast back here,” the Wood Elf continued, hesitant to disturb the ranger in his watch.  “You’re more than welcome to join us, if you’re hungry.”<br>
<br>
“My little druid,” the ranger said in his rasping voice, “I have consumed more taro root in my lifetime than you have breathed air.  No thanks, I won’t be joining you.”<br>
<br>
Laera swallowed.  “Well… is there anything we can do to thank you for your kindness in watching over our sleep?  We owe you a great debt after all you’ve done for us last night and before-“<br>
<br>
“No,” the ranger replied curtly.  “There is nothing I require from you, nor is there anything you have that is of value to me.”<br>
<br>
At hearing the ranger’s abruptness, Laera meekly turned around to make her way back to the camp.  She shrugged, figuring he was loath to be disturbed at the moment, when she stopped suddenly.  Something deep inside the druid that had been touched by Dreketh’s cynicism tugged at her, calling attention to a burning question.  After a moment’s consideration, the Wood Elf decided it must be answered.<br>
<br>
Laera turned back around.  “Then why are you looking out for us?”<br>
<br>
“I have my reasons,” the ranger replied.<br>
<br>
“But-“<br>
<br>
“Listen to me, druid, and understand,” the ranger continued.  “What happens to two children just out of their diapers is of little interest to me.”<br>
<br>
Laera pressed her lips together resolutely.  Balling her hands into small fists, she stood erect and walked around the ranger to look him straight in the eyes.  <br>
<br>
“Really?” she said, her expression stern – almost comically so, as she confronted the seasoned ranger.  “Then why follow us?  Do you make it a habit to pursue all ‘children’ around Norrath, wiping our noses, or is it just the young, helpless females that catch your fancy?”<br>
<br>
“I saved your ‘young, helpless female’ asses more than once,” the ranger returned in a quiet, but scathing voice.  “More often than not, you didn’t even know the danger was present before I fitfully put it to rest.  The least you could do is show some respect.”<br>
<br>
“I thought you didn’t want anything from us?” Laera asked peevishly, her hands spread wide.<br>
<br>
“I don’t,” the ranger replied.  Standing quickly, he turned to take his leave from this impudent upstart.<br>
<br>
“I’ve known people just like you!”  Laera’s voice rose to catch the ranger’s attention, halting him.  “Standing so high in your ivory tower, shrouded in all your righteous deeds saying ‘look at me, I’m the sacrificing hero that saves the day.’  Where is the prestige when you think it entitles you to treat others like dirt because they don’t measure up to your moral stature?  Huh?”<br>
<br>
The ranger turned halfway to look the Wood Elf in the eyes.<br>
<br>
Laera stood firm.  “I was sent out here by a person exactly like you – someone I held in awe until I actually met him.  Now I see him as nothing but a cruel and heartless demagogue who feeds off his own glory.<br>
<br>
“So yes,” the Wood Elf concluded, “we owe you a debt.  But if it means we have to deal with your superiority, then we’d just assume be without your company until the next time you feel the need to trump yourself up.”<br>
<br>
Turning, Laera began to stomp off back to the camp.<br>
<br>
“Wait.”  The ranger held forth a gloved hand.  Laera stopped, her features a cold mask of stone as she felt the mysterious man approach from behind.  “I fear I have given you a mistaken impression of me,” she heard his voice speak softly behind her.<br>
<br>
“Who are you?” Laera whispered.  “We don’t even know your name.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t give it out to many,” the ranger replied.  “Most people are content with calling me ‘hey you.’ ”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf turned, detecting a hint of remorse in the man’s voice.  The ranger spoke again, however, before she could make any comment.<br>
<br>
“Where’s your friend?” he asked evenly.<br>
<br>
Laera cast an offhanded glance back at the camp.  “Dreketh’s bathing down at the lake,” she replied.<br>
<br>
“You’re not supposed to be far from one another, you know,” the ranger said.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, well, I draw the line when it comes to-“ Laera halted mid-sentence.  Raising her eyes to the ranger, her gaze narrowed suspiciously.  “What… what are you talking about?”<br>
<br>
The ranger sighed through his nose sharply, shaking his head.  “You have no gift for subterfuge, druid.”  Turning, the ranger returned to the boulder he had been sitting on.<br>
<br>
Her interest piqued, Laera followed.  “You… you know about the Pact?” she asked, her voice low.<br>
<br>
The ranger cast the druid a brief, neutral glance, his gaze quickly returning to the rising sun.  “You seem surprised.”<br>
<br>
“Well… I am, a little.”  The Wood Elf shrugged as she sat on the boulder next to him.  “So far, everyone we’ve met who knew anything about the Pact has tried to kill us.”<br>
<br>
The ranger smiled in spite of himself, his expression hidden in the shadows of his hat.  Several moments of silence passed before Laera posed another burning question she had wanted answered for a long time.<br>
<br>
“You’re a follower of Erollisi Marr… aren’t you?”<br>
<br>
The ranger turned a probing eye to the Wood Elf.  “What makes you think that?”<br>
<br>
“Before you left us in Kithicor, you said that you do what you do out of love,” Laera replied softly.<br>
<br>
“I could have been talking about anything,” he countered, his voice sharp and emotionless.<br>
<br>
“That’s what I thought at first,” the Wood Elf nodded once, rising to the challenge.  “But then we found out about Zeranon’s Chalice and which god now has it.”<br>
<br>
The ranger froze his gaze in place, making no comment.  <br>
<br>
“Then I thought if there was one god whose minion would not be out to kill us like everyone else, which one would it be?” Laera continued, raising an eyebrow.  “Erollisi Marr topped my list.  Of all the gods – even Tunare Herself – Erollisi’s minion would not be a murderer… would he?”<br>
<br>
“Your theory is flawed,” the ranger said.  “Erollisi Marr wishes to keep the Chalice safe from the hands of Innoruuk and your goddess.  If I were sent by the Queen of Love, why would I strive to protect you?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf leaned forward, her eyes clear.  “You tell me.”<br>
<br>
The ranger laughed – a rare occurrence that few people ever saw.  “Now I question if a gift for subterfuge is the only thing you lack, druid.”  Laera bristled at the ranger’s piercing remark.  “But regardless of your reasoning at how you’ve come to this conclusion, I will answer your question.”<br>
<br>
The ranger paused dramatically.  “I am not a worshipper of Erollisi Marr,” he said.<br>
<br>
Laera’s skeptical eyes continued searching the ranger’s hidden face in vain.  Though she found no hint of deception, something inside her still refused to accept his words as the truth.<br>
<br>
“I don’t believe you,” she said plainly.<br>
<br>
“And do you know why you don’t believe me?” the ranger asked, his dour voice tinged with derision.<br>
<br>
“Enlighten me,” Laera replied shortly.<br>
<br>
The ranger leaned in close to speak conspiratorially with the Wood Elf.  “Because you still don’t know enough to ask the right questions,” he said in a furtive tone.  Sitting back up straight, the ranger continued in his normal rasping voice.  “You believe that the little tidbit of knowledge you have gleaned from the Library in Erudin has given you special insight into what is really going on.  You couldn’t be more wrong – as you are about to discover once you reach Faydwer.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s sharp eyes followed the ranger as he stood and stepped deftly to the ground.  “If you have all the insight,” she asked grimly, “then why not just tell me what I need to know and save us all the trouble?”<br>
<br>
The ranger looked up at Wood Elf, now sitting alone on the boulder.  “Because it will take time for you to travel to Ak’Anon,” he said.  “And right now, time is exactly what the Pact needs for all parties involved – your own goddess included.”<br>
<br>
Laera scowled, resenting the fact that throughout their entire conversation, this enigmatic Human had revealed nothing at all useful.  Furthermore, if her gut feeling was correct, he had even lied to protect his own identity and motives.<br>
<br>
The ranger glanced toward the rising sun once again.  “It’s getting late,” he said.  “You had better find your friend and get a move on to Freeport.  The faster you get there, the faster you arrive on Faydwer and the sooner you will have the answers you seek.”  <br>
<br>
Having said his peace, the ranger began to take his leave, when he stopped to turn and speak briefly in a sardonic voice.  “Oh, and by the way… the name is Ranin Treestalker,” he said, bowing in his self-introduction.  “I hope that helps you.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf sat, watching the ranger walk off into the distance.<br>
<br>
“Thanks for nothing,” she said under her breath.<br>

<br>
Journey to Ak’Anon – Ocean of Tears – Day 3<br>
<br>
Weeks ago, I said I knew in my heart that I would see Faydark Forest again some day.  That time is nearly here, and now it seems like I wrote that journal entry ages ago.  Qeynos is only a bitter memory to me, and now I sit on a ship in the Ocean of Tears on my way home.<br>
<br>
That’s right.  Home.  Or, as near to home as I can hope to come.  Dreketh would never be allowed inside Kelethin.<br>
<br>
Still, I can’t wait to see Greater Faydark again!  We should be docking at the seaport in Butcherblock come daybreak, and if we travel swiftly through the mountains, we may reach my home in time to camp the night there!  For the first time in weeks, I’m intensely excited – even if it’s as trite as catching a glimpse of my home again.  The soft candlelight shining through the windows high up in the trees is something I’d give my right arm to see right now.  If only for a moment I can forget all about covetous gods, Dark Elves, necromancers and dark prophecies.  It would mean so much if I could forget my part in all this and go back to dreaming the naïve dreams of an acolyte.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s health improves daily.  I don’t think this boat ride is doing much for her endurance, but she says it’s a necessary evil.<br>
<br>
Necessary evil… sweet Tunare, what those words entail now.  Dreketh still refuses to talk about her nightmares and what her people did to her in Neriak.  That used to really bother me, but now from what little I can make out from her ramblings at night, I don’t think I want to know.  On top of the excruciating pain, I gather that she was also made an object of loathing and ridicule by people who were her peers at one time.  I can’t speak for Dreketh, mind you, but I get the feeling that that hurt her as much, if more than the physical pain she endured.<br>
<br>
I suppose such experiences have a way of changing people, for Dreketh is truly a changed person.  Where once I constantly ran up against nothing but derision and condescension, I’ve found need and forbearance.  It has been an awkward transition, and I’m still not entirely sure how to deal with it.  At least when she insulted me in the past, I knew how to react.<br>
<br>
Sheesh, will you listen to me?  Before, I could do nothing but write about Dreketh’s faults and how crazy it made me.  I wished daily that Tunare had delivered a travelling companion who was different, and now that I have my wish, I suddenly feel out of my element.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, it does feel good to be needed – even if it is by a Teir’Dal.  I wouldn’t wish Dreketh’s fate on my worst enemy, mind you, but I am thankful that she’s finally opening up.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to the subject of her parents.  To take her mind off the constant dipping and weaving motions of the ship, she told me all she knew about her parents and their deaths.  At hearing the specifics of how her mother was discovered on the battlefield, I turned even sicker than Dreketh.  What happened is an atrocity, plain and simple.  I cannot believe another soul (several other souls, by all accounts) could do something so horrid to a living being.  Even now, I feel the urge to run to the ship’s railings as I write about it.<br>
<br>
It does explain a lot about Dreketh, though.  Her heritage notwithstanding, I can’t say that I wouldn’t have turned out to be a cynical, embittered person had that happened to my parents.  Being a Teir’Dal was already one strike against her when it comes to social graces (I do hope she doesn’t read this), but these events had to have sealed her fate.<br>
<br>
Keeping that in mind, Dreketh showed me the scar on her arm where she vowed revenge on her parents’ murderers in some vague Teir’Dal blood oath (I didn’t feel up to asking about the details).  Of course, I had previously noticed the scar when I was caring for her in the Commonlands.  I was mildly curious about it before, but now I see that scar in a whole new light.  You could say it’s taken on a light of its own, for I see that scar every time I look at Dreketh now.  It is always clearly visible to me, even through bronze armor.<br>
<br>
What all this amounts to is this…<br>
<br>
When I made my last entry into this journal, I was certain of who I was and who Dreketh was, and how we did not belong together.  I knew with a certainty that Tunare was challenging my faith, and I resented it with a bitterness that even rivaled my uncouth partner’s.  <br>
<br>
Now, after so much has happened, things have changed.  A lot depends on what we discover about the Pact of Zeranon, but I’m starting to believe that it is time to turn the tables a little.  If Tunare wishes to challenge my faith, She's welcome to it.  In turn, I challenge Her involvement in the Pact.  I dearly hope Her intentions are benign.  At one point this would never be in question for me, but now, after all I have seen and heard… I do question.  I hate myself for it, but I do.  <br>
<br>
Nevertheless, I remain Her devout servant.  I will do what She asks of me – misgivings and all.  I only wish She would be more plain about what it is She wants.  Time will tell.  It had better, because so far nobody else has.<br>
<br>
- Laera Nellynwae, Druid of Tunare<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The brittle, dry leaves crunched beneath the druid’s booted feet.  Looking down with a grin, Laera stomped her way along the path in the same way she used to as a child growing up in this region.  Once again, small Laera Nellynwae walked among the trees of the Greater Faydark.  Of course, during the course of her journeys, she had seen a number of forests with a myriad of similar trees, but this was different – these were her trees.  The mists were her mists.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh stared at her with a sidelong glance, her expression incisive, but not disparaging.  She had never before seen the druid this way.  Normally Laera took on a somber manner that was more depressing than anything.  Yet here she was, ecstatic and full of energy.  Playful.<br>
<br>
“Give it years, and I still don’t think I’ll ever understand you, Wood Elf,” the shadow knight said, shaking her head.<br>
<br>
Laera chuckled under her breath and spread her arms wide, similar to the way she had done in the rain back in Qeynos Hills.  The druid reveled, obviously not caring what her companion -- or anyone on Norrath, for that matter -- thought of it one way or the other.  She was home, and that was all that mattered.<br>
<br>
Dreketh suppressed a twinge of envy for her companion and the joy she witnessed.  The sheer contrast between her own homecoming and the druid’s dug into her like a dagger when she realized that all Laera had to do was walk several yards in one direction and she would be met by friends and family happy to see her.  Where Laera was welcomed with open arms, Dreketh was welcomed at the end of a blade.  Where Laera would lie in a safe, comfortable bed, Dreketh lay stripped and bound in cold iron chains on a stone slab.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight shook her head, dismissing the memory with a sneer.  What was done is done.  She deserved it and nothing less.  Time to move on.  Leave the past alone.  Time to move on.<br>
<br>
Some day, perhaps she would be able to.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, she did her best to weather the Wood Elf’s incessant buoyancy.  Since stepping foot into the misty forest of Greater Faydark the previous night, Laera’s smile hadn’t waned an inch.  The druid actually giggled at one point, and Dreketh simply had to leave for several minutes before she gave into her violent urges to throttle her companion.<br>
<br>
Annoying as it was, the Dark Elf had to admit that Laera’s revelry had infectious qualities.  A part of her wished she could join in and experience such joy.  She wondered what it would be like to cut loose her strict control and discipline to indulge in a moment of unfettered delight.  But it was not to be.  She was a disciple of Innoruuk.  Such things as joy and delight were counterproductive to the principle of hate, and were therefore corrupt.  Besides, her people had no reason for revelry – only their purpose.<br>
<br>
Dreketh stole another sidelong glance at the druid next to her, insisting to herself that she had no regrets.  She had to remind herself that she was standing in the very heart of enemy territory.  Not only was the Wood Elf city nearby, but the reviled High Elves made their home in the Faydark as well.  Felwithe was an even greater threat, for its people were of a more serious breed than their Wood Elf cousins.<br>
<br>
Forgetting any potentially blasphemous thoughts she may have had moments before, the shadow knight kept a wary eye out for any travelers that may be about.  One guard on patrol is all it would take, and she would become yet another historical statistic for her people to take vengeance on.  Exile or no, she would rather that not come to pass.<br>
<br>
The morning progressed without incident.  The few travelers who did chance upon the companions fell victim to the Dark Elf’s stealthy talents, remaining oblivious to her presence.  Occasionally, Laera would make contact with these passersby, eager to catch up on current events.  Whenever she returned, however, she carried with her a bemused expression as if something wasn’t quite right.<br>
<br>
“I can’t put my finger on it,” she said one time.  “Everyone seems stilted, like they’re putting on some brave front or something.”<br>
<br>
“And that’s unusual?” Dreketh asked distractedly, only half-interested.<br>
<br>
“Well, not for High Elves, I suppose,” the druid admitted with a small shrug.  She thumbed over her shoulder as she spoke.  “But those were Wood Elves back there.  It’s very uncharacteristic for my own people.  We normally don’t have a care in the world, unless…” Her voice trailed off.<br>
<br>
“Unless what?”  The shadow knight continued to scan the trees all about.<br>
<br>
“Nevermind,” Laera said, shaking her head slightly.  It was obvious to the druid that Dreketh wasn’t the slightest bit interested in Wood Elf politics.  Best to move on to another subject.  “So, what do you think?”<br>
<br>
“What do I think about what?”<br>
<br>
Laera spread her arms wide, gesturing at the trees all about.  “What do you think about the Faydark?”<br>
<br>
“If you must know, it makes me nervous,” Dreketh replied caustically.  “There’s no telling who’s out there watching us, ready to turn my head into their latest trophy on the mantle.”<br>
<br>
“Now that’s disgusting,” Laera said with a revolting look.  “You may be used to such things in Neriak, but my-“<br>
<br>
“You know what I mean,” Dreketh interrupted peevishly.  “I’m not welcome here any more than you are in Nektulos.  And thanks to your people’s self-stylized sense of morality, I can’t masquerade as your slave if we’re caught.”<br>
<br>
Laera opened her mouth as if to say something, but checked herself at the last moment, looking into the trees with a hunted look.  “Did you hear that?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“Our only hope would be for you to say I’m your prisoner,” Dreketh continued, ignoring the Wood Elf’s question.  “Though what sort of reason you could give for not having killed me already is-“<br>
<br>
“Shh!”  Laera grabbed hold of the shadow knight’s shoulder, pulling her to a stop urgently.  “Listen close.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh cocked her head, trying to listen over the usual sounds emanating from the depths of the forest.  “I don’t hear anything.”<br>
<br>
“It sounds like metal hitting metal.  Very faint,” Laera insisted.<br>
<br>
“That?” Dreketh rolled her eyes.  “I’ve been listening to that for ten minutes now.  It sounds like a fight.  It’s a common sound in Nektulos.  Don’t you people have hunting grounds?”<br>
<br>
“There’s no way that’s a normal fight,” the druid said darkly.  “The decrepit skeletons of the Faydark don’t parry blows, and we’re too far from Clan Crushbone for it to be orcs.”  Laera swallowed uneasily.<br>
<br>
Dreketh listened to the sounds with more attention.  “It’s consistent… almost rhythmic,” she said thoughtfully.  “How close are we to the gnomes?  Could it be something they’re doing?”<br>
<br>
“We’re just entering Lesser Faydark,” Laera replied, skeptical but hesitant.  “It’s not impossible, but my gut says it’s something different.  I’ve never heard a sound quite like it in all my years growing up here.”<br>
<br>
The two stood alone, silently listening to the recurring sounds of metal echoing among the trees.<br>
<br>
“It sounds like it’s coming from this direction,” Dreketh said, pointing off to the right.  “Are there any hills or mountains around to get a better look?”<br>
<br>
“There’s a ridge up ahead that divides the forest,” Laera replied.  “That’s where Greater Faydark ends and Lesser Faydark begins.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight turned a concerned eye toward the unnerved druid standing next to her.  “You want to have a look?” she asked pointedly.<br>
<br>
“Could we?”<br>
<br>
“Okay,” Dreketh said, nodding.  “Anything to get off this path.”<br>
<br>
As the two companions made their way toward the ridge, they recognized the metallic sounds growing louder with each passing minute.  A silent glance between them confirmed this fact to the other, and they pressed on without a word.  Soon, they found themselves laboring up the side of the ridge Laera spoke of, the sounds becoming ever louder the closer they approached Lesser Faydark beyond.  The louder the sounds grew, the darker the shadow knight’s expression became.<br>
<br>
“Are you all right?” Laera asked cautiously, noting the sudden change in the Dark Elf’s manner.<br>
<br>
“I know this sound,” Dreketh replied evenly.  The ridge’s crest loomed several feet away, the metallic sounds ringing more clearly as they climbed.<br>
<br>
“Blades,” the Wood Elf said, nodding as she climbed the rocky terrain.  “Something’s going on in Lesser Faydark.  Nothing ever happens there – not this close to the ridge.”<br>
<br>
“I know what it is,” the Dreketh muttered.  With a scowl, the Dark Elf redoubled her efforts to reach the top, leaving Laera to scurry behind to catch up.<br>
<br>
“Well, by all means don’t go telling anybody,” the druid said sarcastically as she reached out to pull herself over the top.  “Like the Erudite says, ignorance is essential to-” Laera’s words stopped short as she looked out into the forested hills of Lesser Faydark.  “Tunare’s mercy…” she whispered breathlessly.<br>
<br>
“Not quite the term I would use,” Dreketh muttered as she peered calmly to the ground below.<br>
<br>
Before them, nestled among the sparse trees, stood an army teeming with numbers well into the tens of thousands.  High Elves, Wood Elves, and a highly respectable number of Humans could be seen in orderly ranks as they went through battle drills with one another – hence the ringing metal sounds bleeding into Greater Faydark.  <br>
<br>
But sparring and battle maneuvers alone were not the sole cause of the ruckus that disturbed the forest.  Off to the side, a number of glowing forges had been constructed.  Men wearing the trappings of Freeport citizens labored away the noontime hours to create weapons and armor with which to outfit this army.  Cooks labored over boiling pots and sizzling grills to feed the army.  Messengers raced between ironclad soldiers, delivering reports.  The camp was alive with bustling activity of every manner.<br>
<br>
Closer to the ridge, lined up along its base stood rows of straw dummies where archers practiced their prowess with the bow.  Upon closer inspection, Laera could see that the straw had been dyed blue, granting them a significant racial overtone.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf glanced slowly over at her scowling partner.  “Those… could be orcs from Crushbone,” she suggested hesitantly.  “They have bluish skin, too, you know.  Kelethin has been struggling with them right at our doorstep for years.  Maybe we’re going to do something about it once and for-“<br>
<br>
“Open your eyes, Wood Elf!” Dreketh exploded.  She thrust an angry finger toward the teeming army in the distance.  “Look down there!  There are easily over twelve thousand Elves and Humans!  All of Crushbone would collapse under a tenth of that number!”<br>
<br>
Laera couldn’t look at the Dark Elf.  Instead, she turned to look down at the army, her eyes straying to the straw dummies close by, their blue “bodies” riddled with literally thousands of arrows lodged into them grotesquely.  Had they been actual flesh and blood, the carnage would not have been dissimilar to the gore Dreketh described in her mother’s death.<br>
<br>
“No,” Dreketh concluded grimly.  “Soon this army marches on Neriak.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There was no denying it – the army of light was no coffee and cake run.  The force of tens of thousands strong was to be wielded by Tunare’s Divine Hand and cast straight into the heart of the Teir’Dal, sending the Elf nations into one of the largest wars in recent history.  Largest due to sheer numbers, granted, but also due to whatever connection it might have held with the Pact of Zeranon.  The massing of this force alongside the principle gods’ declaration of the Pact was something neither of the young women could accept as being mere coincidence.<br>
<br>
But what was the connection?  Was the war to be waged for possession of the Chalice?  It seemed the obvious answer.  But how could that be if its whereabouts were unknown?  If possession was the goal, it would likely be more of a race to get there first once the location was discovered.  But swiftness is not something you achieve with this many people – especially overseas.  No, the Chalice may have been a part of it, certainly, but not directly.  <br>
<br>
And what of the Teir’Dal forces?  Was a similar army being formed near Neriak?<br>
<br>
“If so, it will be massing in Lavastorm,” Dreketh explained on their way through Lesser Faydark.  At first, the Dark Elf objected to entering an enemy training ground where she was certain to be caught and executed as a spy.  But, after repeated assurances that Laera knew a shortcut that led straight to Ak’Anon, the shadow knight agreed to give it a try.<br>
<br>
“Then why didn’t you hear word of it when you were in Neriak?” the Wood Elf pressed.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me deeply, but I was just a tad distracted at the time!” Dreketh replied harshly.<br>
<br>
“I’m just saying an army to match this size isn’t something you can keep secret for very long,” Laera said, placating her hot-tempered companion.<br>
<br>
“No, it isn’t,” the shadow knight replied, calming down.  “For some reason everyone knows about it, but nobody’s talking – not openly, anyway.  When that happens, it usually means something suspicious is happening behind the scenes that keeps everyone speculating about what’s really going on.”<br>
<br>
“Whatever it is, we need answers fast,” Laera said, picking up her pace to match Dreketh’s long strides.  “If that army really is connected to the Pact, I’d rather not be caught in the middle if we can help it.”<br>
<br>
“We may not have a choice,” the Dark Elf responded with her usual cynicism.  “But you’re right – we need answers.  It’s about time we got them.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The shadow knight cursed under her breath for the twelfth time that evening as she watched the sun dipping low through the western sky.  She didn’t like this one bit – the Pact said the two of them were to stay together, never to wander far from each other for any real length of time.  Already the Wood Elf had been inside the city of Ak’Anon for three hours without any sign she was coming out.  The closely guarded entrance to the underground Gnome city proved to be a hindrance, however, making their separation unavoidable.<br>
<br>
Yet again, the shadow knight’s lineage had proven to be an annoying hindrance to their quest.  It suddenly occurred to Dreketh how there was really no port of call on this continent for Dark Elves.  The Dwarven home of Kaladim lay on the west coast and Ak’Anon lay to the southeast, with Kelethin and Felwithe in between.  None of the peoples on this continent were exactly sympathetic to the Teir’Dal cause.  Quite the contrary, it was difficult to remain sympathetic when you’re being held with a blade to your throat.  This being the case, no place existed where a Dark Elf could seek refuge.  Well, no civilized place…<br>
<br>
Dreketh cursed the Wood Elf, she cursed Gnomes and their impregnable underground city, she cursed the Pact, and she cursed everything else she could think of as she waited impatiently for her companion to return.<br>
<br>
The novelty of the Steamfont Mountains had long worn thin on the Dark Elf.  At first, the unique mountain range had earned Dreketh’s grudging respect.  From the very rock, huge clouds of steam emerged in geysers and boiling ponds – hence the name of the region.  It was said that below the ground existed a complex network of rivers heated by Solusek Ro, god of fire.  Or it was Norrath’s naturally heated core, depending on who you talked to at the time.  Additionally, intense heat from the incessant eruptions from below had the effect of causing the air to rise, resulting in a perpetual humid wind throughout the mountains and hills.<br>
<br>
Nowhere in Norrath was there such an abundance of natural energies to be found – making it an ideal home for the inventive Gnome race.  It was that very ingenuity that was the defining characteristic of the Gnomes, and the source of their pride.  Harnessing this abundance of energy in a variety of ways, ranging from windmills to underwater turbines below the ground, the clever Gnomes had evolved a technology that was nothing short of miraculous compared to the other races.  They had mastered the principles of mechanical energies to the point of creating synthetic automatons to handle the more mundane aspects of life.  These clockwork machines built to resemble their Gnome masters could handle even seemingly complex tasks – defense, law enforcement, even trade skills and bartering.<br>
<br>
But tinkering with the cog and spring alone did not achieve this miracle.  The Gnomes delved into a unique arcane practice they called “Mechanimagica” that was a mysterious blending of magic and technology.  Though few members of the other races fully understood how this was accomplished, the results were difficult to refute – though they were often less than perfect in their implementation.<br>
<br>
Movement near the city entrance interrupted the shadow knight’s thoughts.  Dreketh immediately recognized Laera’s tan skin and auburn hair in the distance as the Wood Elf cast about in search of her companion.  <br>
<br>
Glancing over her shoulder to be certain there were no unfriendlies nearby, Dreketh let loose a small whistle.  Turning, Laera could see the Dark Elf signaling to her from behind a collection of boulders off to one side of the valley.  With her accustomed agility, the druid broke into a run toward the hiding place.<br>
<br>
“Let me guess,” Dreketh said once the Wood Elf arrived.  “You couldn’t find their toiletries.”<br>
<br>
“Huh?” Laera replied, trying to catch her breath from the run.<br>
<br>
“Nevermind,” the Dark Elf replied dismissively.  “Did you find anything?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, filthy water!”  Laera looked disgusted.  “It’s repulsive, the pollution they have down there.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh was again on the verge of throttling the Wood Elf.  “Did you find anything by Widdlethorp!”<br>
<br>
“Uhm…no,” Laera responded hesitantly.  “There were several references to Widdlethorps who had written numerous books through the centuries, but none from Zeranon’s era, nor were there manuscripts that had anything to do with the Pact.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh slumped, her back against one large boulder that stood between her and the rest of Steamfont.  She couldn’t believe that they had come all this way just to run into a dead end.  Raising her hand, she tiredly rubbed her forehead.<br>
<br>
“But, I did find out something that’s going to throw you clear to Erudin and back,” the Wood Elf continued with a gleam in her eye.<br>
<br>
Letting her hand fall, Dreketh opened her eyes to stare blandly at her companion, her mouth closed in a small frown.<br>
<br>
“The Widdlethorp we’re looking for – Dathan – actually lived during the time of Zeranon,” Laera said with a small grin.  “If that wasn’t enough, are you ready for this…?”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight stared grimly at Laera, the Wood Elf’s dramatics remaining unappreciated.<br>
<br>
“He is still alive.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh blinked languidly her obvious skepticism.  “A two thousand year old Gnome?”<br>
<br>
“I know,” Laera replied with a shrug.  “The Gnomes of the Eldritch Collective can’t explain it either, but it’s true.  Apparently he’s some unsung legend to the locals out here in Steamfont.  Oh, and Widdlethorp isn’t a writer – he’s a wizard.  Apparently his entry in the almanac was a fluke.  Either that, or the librarian suggested that it may be some vague excerpt from a magical tome he wrote that is lost or forbidden outside certain circles.  The way Erudites stockpile knowledge, it wouldn't be the first time something like that was stolen from Gnome archives.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight put her head in her hands, trying to absorb this information and what it all meant.  On the surface, being able to talk to someone who actually lived during the era Zeranon had marched against the gods was a dream come true.  Unlike the rest of the world, he obviously knew something of events that took place throughout the planes at the time.<br>
<br>
Then why did she suddenly feel so uneasy?  Perhaps it was the idea of talking to someone who was purportedly 2000 years old, but she didn’t think so.  Perhaps now, after so many days of travel with no measurable progress being made, Dreketh now felt the pressure of having things come to a head.<br>
<br>
Whatever it was, the shadow knight didn’t appreciate the feeling.  She tried her best to suppress the sensation of anxiety that pervaded her chest and arms.  She stubbornly ignored the bordering nausea she could detect in the pit of her stomach, and put on a stalwart front.  <br>
<br>
Pushing herself away from the boulder against which she leaned, Dreketh turned to address her companion.<br>
<br>
“Do you know where this Dathan Widdlethorp is?” she asked.<br>
<br>
Laera smiled and nodded.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="file:///storyline/storyIL.txt">Table of Contents</a><br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 19 - The Wizard</c><br>
<br>
“You flea-ridden varmint!” Dathan Widdlethorp piped in his small, Gnomish voice.  “I said for you to go fetch my slippers, and I meant it!  Now scoot, or I swear you’ll catch a fate worse than death!!”<br>
<br>
The short, white haired wizard waved an angry fist at the dog curled up at the foot of his overstuffed chair.  The miserable pooch’s long, brown face lifted slowly from off its paws to cast an almost comical look of despair up at its barking master.  Widdlethorp made several more encouraging gestures at the disobedient animal, to no avail.  <br>
<br>
In the end, as always, the elderly Gnome relented.  “Aw, you lazy sack o’ kobold skin,” the wizard grunted as he pushed himself from his favorite seat.  “Some day you’re gonna push my patience past the line, and then you’re really gonna see trouble!  You hear me?  Yeah, that’s right, I’m talkin’ to you!”<br>
<br>
Blinking in a silent, oblivious response, the dog merely sniffed at the gnarled finger the old Gnome thrust at it.  Finding nothing of interest, it rested its limp jowls slowly back down to the dirt-laden floor to fall asleep once again. <br>
<br>
“Mutt!” the wizard mumbled, followed by several unintelligible obscenities as he stomped his way into the bedroom.<br>
<br>
For millennia, Widdlethorp had lived out his timeless years as a hermit, nestled in the protective and relatively remote arms of Steamfont.  Though a hotbed for adventurers to hunt down sinister minotaurs and errant rogue clockwork that had escaped control of the gnome city of Ak’Anon, the Mountains of Steamfont remained one of the few regions of Norrath that was left, for the most part, undisturbed by the rest of the world.  This suited Widdlethorp fine, as he had long since lost interest in the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
The embittered old Gnome coveted few things of value, as was made apparent by his dwelling.  Unlike the fine Gnome craftsmanship that was evident in the other structures that pock marked the ferals of Steamfont, Widdlethorp’s dwelling more resembled a sorry attempt at copying the nondescript mounds that Halflings preferred in Misty Thicket thousands of miles away.  Though his fellow Gnomes found the odd dwelling baffling, Widdlethorp enjoyed several advantages to it.  First and foremost, it was comfortable.  Being surrounded by three feet of solid dirt and groundcover ensured no chilling drafts would freeze his feet while he slept.  Second, it was unobtrusive.  The uncouth appearance when compared to the “extravagance” of the other dwellings in the land tended to keep annoying people at bay.<br>
<br>
The old Gnome had no use for people.  After all, what good were they?  Always wanting, needy, ungrateful and asking questions – incessant questions!  “Widdlethorp, why aren’t you dead?”  “Widdlethorp, what was Norrath like two thousand years ago?”  “Widdlethorp, can you cure my warts?”  “Widdlethorp, we’re being clobbered by the forces of Rallos Zek – could you please lend a hand?”  It was a ceaseless line of nonsensical, irrelevant things that always made him want to puke!<br>
<br>
What Widdlethorp lacked in relationships, he made up for in mystique.  The whispered rumors were indeed true.  The old wizard really was, in fact, two thousand years old.  <br>
<br>
The first five hundred years were the worst.  The Gnome’s longevity began to manifest itself unmistakably when his peers began to kick the bucket all around him left and right.  Years crept by until eventually the other Gnomes, being the curious lot they were, sent several calculations through their tiny little heads.  It so turned out that, had Widdlethorp been a father, the old man’s children’s children’s children should all have been resting comfortably in their tombs decades ago.<br>
<br>
That was when the wizard’s notoriety among the Gnome population exploded into sheer fame.  Admittedly, he found it novel at first, being the focus of utter mystery and awe by others.  But it wasn’t long before he discovered that novelty and immortality really didn’t mix.  Before long -- about two hundred years later -- Widdlethorp grew irritated at being referred to as “Father Time,” “Undying Dathan,” and “Old Widdle the Ancient Wizard.”  It suddenly struck him one day how such things were simply not going to go away with the passage of time, and if he wanted to keep himself from gleefully murdering his race and those of surrounding lands, steps were going to have to be taken.<br>
<br>
The thieves’ guild had a saying:  “Fame is an empty purse.”  Widdlethorp couldn’t have agreed more.  It had taken some doing, but the old wizard managed to destroy all formal records pertaining to the time of his birth.  Wherever possible, Dathan Widdlethorp struck from the record any evidence of his advanced years, or that he even officially existed.  <br>
<br>
In the short term, this did very little for his renown.  Word-of-mouth was a powerful adversary, and one he despised.  However, immortality made time his ally.  Given the passage of years and his continued efforts to retain anonymity, eventually his name fell into obscurity, and once again he could enjoy the simple things life granted to an ordinary, unremarkable man.<br>
<br>
Nondescript as he had managed to become, Widdlethorp’s labors could not withstand the staying power of the everlasting rumor mill.  Though he saw to it that no official document existed to back up the legend of Undying Dathan, the people of the area still whispered his story amongst each other to that day – some swearing its truth in the face of complete skepticism.  <br>
<br>
This didn’t bother Widdlethorp in the least, so long as his name didn’t erupt into sudden popularity again.  For all the wild speculation being tossed about regarding the cause of his failure to die, Widdlethorp knew fully well the reason he was still alive.  He also knew that the truth would never be discovered, no matter how outrageous the gossip became.<br>
<br>
A knock sounded at his door.<br>
<br>
From behind the bed where he knelt down to search for his slippers, Widdlethorp’s head popped up.  Sunbeams shined through the small window behind him, bathing his thin wisps of white hair in an almost ethereal halo.<br>
<br>
“Great Bayle’s nose hair!” he cursed.  “Don’t people know a hermit can’t stay a hermit long if people keep showin’ up to pester him?  Go away!”  <br>
<br>
Forgetting that his last visitor had been well over two months ago, the old Gnome insisted to himself and others that the lines of people traipsing through his house were endless.  Those who knew Widdlethorp -- and there weren’t many -- merely nodded their sympathies, having learned long ago how much safer it was never to contradict the wizard’s spoken opinion.<br>
<br>
Grumbling, Widdlethorp bent over again to search for his wayward slippers.  Obviously, some unknown force had enchanted them, he thought to himself.  They had never wandered off before.  It was unseemly behavior for such attire to go gallivanting through the house on their own.<br>
<br>
The knock was insistently repeated.<br>
<br>
“Beat it!” the old man shouted from behind the bed.  “And don’t let the windmills whap you in the fanny on the way home!”<br>
<br>
“Dathan Widdlethorp?” called a muffled voice.<br>
<br>
The wizard rose again, this time to rest his elbows on top of the mattress as he ran small hands through his hair in frustration.  Looking up with a frown, Widdlethorp’s sharp eyes peered through his open bedroom doorway to the front door in the living area.  The door mocked him silently as he sat there contemplating it in frustrated silence.<br>
<br>
“What!” he barked, finally.<br>
<br>
“Uh… could we talk to you a moment?” came another muffled voice, similar to the first one.  Female, of course, but definitely not Gnomish.  <br>
<br>
Probably Elven, Widdlethorp thought to himself  <br>
<br>
“Est parali feir’dal, senlyen douchai vellanis char!” he shouted back in the Elven tongue.  Satisfied at having adroitly told them where to go, the old man smiled a satisfied grin as he returned to his personal quest.  Widdlethorp prided himself on his ability to make even the elegant language of the Elves sound vulgar.<br>
<br>
Brief moments passed before a strong, metal-clad pounding reverberated through his small abode.  Squealing at the sudden sound ringing through his normally quiet homestead, Widdlethorp leaped to his feet.  Every creative form of profanity emitted from the Gnome’s mouth as he stalked his way into the front room.<br>
<br>
“You people have a lotta nerve showin’ up on my doorstep at all hours,” he shouted, approaching the offending door.  “What is it this time?  An orc pawn look at your little brat the wrong way?  You want me to-“<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp’s tirade was cut short as he flung open the door and found himself staring up into the blue-faced gaze of a towering Teir’Dal female warrior clad in obviously well-used plate mail armor.  The little man screamed aloud as he quickly slammed the door shut again, holding it closed with all the might his little body could muster.<br>
<br>
“Mister Widdlethorp,” called out the first voice.  “We have to talk to you!”<br>
<br>
“Go away!” the wizard replied.  “Leave, or I’ll… I’ll turn all you worthless inkies into gnats!  I mean it!  I’m gettin’ my spell book right now!”<br>
<br>
“Please!  It’s very important!”<br>
<br>
“I have my spell book!” he warned, having not budged an inch.  “I’m lookin’ up the spell as we speak!”<br>
<br>
“It’s about the Pact of Zeranon!”<br>
<br>
The old wizard’s hand froze in place as it reached for an umbrella sitting in its stand next to the door.  His panicked Gnome face turned quizzical as he tried to determine if he had heard the woman correctly.  For some reason the last word rang strikingly familiar.<br>
<br>
“The what?” he called back through the door.<br>
<br>
“The Pact of Zeranon!” came the gruffer of the two female voices.<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp blinked, quick thoughts racing through his mind.  “You mean… this isn’t about the high sovereign’s trousers and the fire ants?”<br>
<br>
A quiet delay ensued.  Either the army of Dark Elves massing outside his door was calculating their next move or they didn’t have a clue what he was talking about.<br>
<br>
“I assure you,” called the same voice as before, “if the Teir’Dal were seeking revenge, it would have been taken out on your little midget hide centuries ago!”<br>
<br>
“Midget!” the old man roared.  Fuming, he whirled about and yanked the door back open.  Contrary to any thoughts of his own safety he may have had, Widdlethorp marched up to glare at the Dark Elf female straight in the knees.   “Nobody uses that word with me!  Not even a white-haired, black-hearted, blue-skinned, foul-smellin’, filth-ridden, card-carryin’, Teir’Dal!”  The old wizard spat his words.<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked down at the Gnome at her feet, taken aback.  The little man was trembling with fury.  Standing up tall, the shadow knight glanced over to Laera, silently garnering the Wood Elf’s take on all this.  Laera merely shrugged in a noncommittal way.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf turned back to address the old man.  “Listen, I don’t know what you’ve done in the past, but we-“<br>
<br>
“No, you wouldn’t,” he interrupted, his voice sharp.  “You don’t have a clue about the smallest fraction of my history!  So, bugger off and leave me to spell out my future in peace!”  Widdlethorp turned his back, his small feet stomping their way inside once again.<br>
<br>
“Please, Mister Widdlethorp, I implore you,” came the more winsome voice from behind.  “It is imperative that we learn a small portion of the vast wisdom you have obtained through the ages.”<br>
<br>
One woolly eyebrow raised, Widdlethorp slowly turned back around to find a shapely, red-haired Wood Elf who had addressed him.  Kneeling down on nicely rounded, finely tanned Elf legs, the comely female had lowered herself in a crouch to speak to him face to face.  Few visitors ever did that – certainly not attractive ones.<br>
<br>
“Hmph,” the old man said, his arms folded.  “Now, what could someone your age need with my wisdom?  Let me guess… man problems.  For what it’s worth, I’ll tell you what I know.  One,” he held up his pudgy index finger, “men are worthless.  If I were you, I’d dump him, whoever he is, and find a platonic roommate or a good pet.  Two, relationships always get in the way.  Never enter into one without knowin’ what you’re gettin’ into.  And three, nobody has ever once known what they were gettin’ into until they were already tangled up in it.”<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp reached up a hand to pat Laera gently on the cheek.  “There now,” he said in a tolerant, but not unkind voice.  “You have gleaned the pinnacle of old Widdlethorp’s wisdom.  Centuries of gatherin’ information, and that is what I have to show for it.  Now run along and don’t feel obligated to tell me how things turns out with you and your beau.”<br>
<br>
The small man turned again to take his leave when a hand stopped him gently on his shoulder from behind.  Turning back around with a harrowed sigh, Widdlethorp grudgingly met the Wood Elf’s remarkable emerald green eyes.<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” she said with sincerity.  “I will always keep your words to heart, wise one.”  <br>
<br>
The Gnome’s gruff expression turned up to the towering Dark Elf briefly, his eyes narrowing suspiciously.  <br>
<br>
“But…?” he asked shortly.<br>
<br>
“But, I’m afraid our matter is of a far more serious nature.”  Laera chose her words carefully.  “We need to talk with you about something you wrote for the Almanac of Arcane History.  A historical piece about a man named Zeranon.”<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp blinked, his gaze turning ponderous.  “Zeranon.  Why does that ring a bell…?”<br>
<br>
“He was a powerful necromancer who waged war on the gods almost two thousand years ago,” the Wood Elf encouraged.  “He did this using a chalice he created called the Cup-“<br>
<br>
“The Cup of Ages,” the Gnome finished for her.  Looking up with a knowing expression, Widdlethorp nodded his head.  “Feirral Zeranon.  Feirral.  I will never forget that name.  But what does he have to do with a pretty little thing like you?”<br>
<br>
Laera grinned, somewhat flustered at the compliment.  “Well, I- we…” she glanced up at Dreketh.  “We are the advocates of the Pact.”<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp’s clear, pristine eyes shown glistening in the morning sun as he gazed at the Wood Elf.  Not a muscle betrayed the wizard’s emotions as he turned his head up toward Dreketh, then slowly back down to Laera kneeling before him.  All was quiet, save for the sound of steam rising from the natural springs all around.  <br>
<br>
A ghastly snorting sound emitted from the Gnome’s nose.  Unable to retain his composure, Widdlethorp covered his mouth in a vain attempt to hide his laughter.<br>
<br>
“You are the advocates of Tunare and Innoruuk?  You two?” he asked, not believing his own words.<br>
<br>
Dreketh folded her arms and looked off into the distance peevishly while Laera pressed her lips together, trying to keep an open mind to what the wizard might have to say.<br>
<br>
Reaching his small hand forward to place it on the Wood Elf’s shoulder, the Gnome struggled to control his wildly grinning face.  Opening his mouth to speak, he hesitated.  At seeing Laera’s serious expression, laughter burst from his lips once more.<br>
<br>
“Good luck!” he said with a mirthful gasp.  He patted the Wood Elf’s arm with mock encouragement, and then turned to take his leave again, his shoulders heaving with mirth.<br>
<br>
“Wait,” Laera said, trying her best to look past the wizard’s insulting demeanor.  “There are some things we need to ask you!”<br>
<br>
“Tell me about it!” Widdlethorp replied gaily over his shoulder.  This was the most entertainment he’d enjoyed in decades.<br>
<br>
Dreketh had had enough.  “Look, little man,” she said, stepping forward and extending her leg to block the Gnome’s path.  “There is an army massing not fifty miles from here, poised and ready to march against my people at a moment’s notice.  If bad comes to worse, war in the heavens is about to be declared once again.”<br>
<br>
“Not just in the heavens, I assure you,” the wizard said with a maniacal grin.<br>
<br>
Dreketh refused to be deterred by the Gnome’s flippancy.  “I have been torn away from a life I enjoyed and a father I held in the deepest respect.  I have fought against minions of the gods.  I have been ridiculed, persecuted, spat upon, beaten and damn near killed because of this Pact.”  She made a gesture toward Laera.  “I have been made to travel the breadth of Norrath in the company of a mortal enemy in search of you, and by the gods I will hear some answers!”<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp shifted his weight.  “You finished?”<br>
<br>
“Not by a long shot,” the Dark Elf said through clenched teeth.  Reaching out, she grabbed the small Gnome by his collar.<br>
<br>
A loud crack of thunder split the air, and Dreketh pulled her hand away with a jerk.  Arcs of lightning shot up and down her arm as she gripped it, doubled over painfully.  Hurriedly, the shadow knight ripped off the gauntlet to find her hand charred black in the places where she touched him.<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked up to see the small wizard standing before her, his expression one of serious calm as he watched.<br>
<br>
“You little bastard,” she whispered, taking a step forward.  <br>
<br>
Two thousand years or no – immortal or no – the enraged shadow knight fully intended to end the old Gnome’s life when her stride was brought short by the Wood Elf’s hand.  Widdlethorp watched calmly as Laera whispered a few short words into her companion’s ear.  What she said, he couldn’t tell, but it had the proper effect on the explosive Teir’Dal.  Though her features remained dire, Dreketh calmed enough to revert back to a sullen, nonviolent state.<br>
<br>
Turning to face the Gnome, Laera squatted down again.  She rested her forearms on her knees to address the wizard.<br>
<br>
“Mister Widdlethorp… may I call you Dathan?” she began.<br>
<br>
The wizard’s eyes meandered downward.  Leaning forward as she was, the druid’s position didn’t exactly lend itself toward modesty.  Widdlethorp quickly discovered he could plainly see a generous portion of bosom from this angle.<br>
<br>
“Please do,” he said, clearing his throat with dignity.<br>
<br>
Laera pasted on the sweetest smile she could muster.  “Dathan,” she said in a carefully kind voice.  “You must understand that my friend and I have traveled a very long way to speak with you.  You seem to know much of what has happened and what is about to happen, so you can see how important it is we speak with you.  If things go sour, it could mean very bad things for everyone.”<br>
<br>
“And what do I care for everyone?” the Gnome asked, folding his arms stubbornly.  “If there is one thing I have learned in the centuries of my life, it’s that people are stupid, fearsome, destructive and dangerous.  Most aren’t worth the skin they’re wrapped in.  I say Norrath is better without their lot – and don’t go sayin’ that my life is at risk as well!”  The small wizard poked a finger toward Laera, interrupting her before she could get a word in.  “After two thousand years of livin’ in this bag of bones, you would welcome death, too!”<br>
<br>
“I-I wouldn’t dream of it,” the Wood Elf replied quickly.  “Really, after traveling this world and seeing how petty and cruel people can be, I can understand your views.  I really can.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” Widdlethorp nodded.<br>
<br>
“But having lived so long, I think you may have overlooked some pretty important things,” Laera said, appealing her case to the Gnome.<br>
<br>
“Like what?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“Like what it’s like to be young,” she whispered, her eyes never leaving his.  “You have lived so long, I think you’ve forgotten what it’s like to pursue a purpose.  And I don’t mean a purpose like some grand duty or quest to save the world, but a purpose in just being alive.  You have spent so many years isolated here in your home that if you died tomorrow, you wouldn’t miss a day of it.  I’ll bet it hasn’t always been like that, has it?”<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp cast his eyes about in midair, refusing to speak.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf placed a hand against her chest as she spoke.  “I’m still young, Dathan.  I have a life I wish to return to after this is all ends, with people I care deeply for.  There are so many wonderful things I wish to experience before my life is over.  I want to see more of Norrath.  I want to learn new skills.  I want to fall in love – perchance to have children one day, each with their own dreams and aspirations that I can share in.  That may not mean much to you, but it’s my world.  It’s what my world is going to be.  Please tell me you don’t wish to cut it short by turning us away now.”<br>
<br>
The wizard couldn’t meet Laera’s eyes.  Instead he shot a glance up at the Dark Elf, glimpsing similar sentiments reflected in her callous face as well – even if she would never admit to them aloud.<br>
<br>
“Damn females,” the old Gnome muttered, kicking at an imaginary stone on the ground.  “More mind tricks than a master enchanter.”<br>
<br>
Laera smiled – a genuine smile this time.<br>
<br>
“Fine, come in,” he said under his breath.  “But don’t be expectin’ any dinner!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Upon entering Widdlethorp’s living room, it became apparent that one ancient, worn-out, cushioned seat was the only amenity of life the wizard afforded himself in the way of furniture.  While Dreketh was perfectly happy to stand, this left Laera with the dilemma of what to do with herself.  Seeing movement near the foot of Widdlethorp’s seat, Laera tilted her head curiously to find a small, brown creature with deep eyes and long, floppy ears.<br>
<br>
“Well, hello there little fella,” she said in a cooing voice.  <br>
<br>
The Wood Elf crouched down, holding her arms out while the dog shuffled and stood to walk its way over and inspect this newcomer with the warm and inviting arms.  Sniffing one hand, it decided she seemed harmless enough and crept closer still to be pet.  The druid’s gentle fingertips scratched the animal’s head, fully winning over its affections.<br>
<br>
“Hmph!” Widdlethorp said, looking at the scene before him.  “Some guard dog you are!  She could have been here to rob me blind, and you’d probably leave with her!”<br>
<br>
The dog’s only response was a mild “woof!” as it turned over to have its belly scratched.<br>
<br>
‘So!” Widdlethorp said, taking his seat.  “Who found the Chalice, anyway?”<br>
<br>
The sudden question took the two young women by surprise.  Though they hadn’t expected the Gnome to be the most courteous of hosts, having lived alone for so long as he had, they did find his cordial manner to lean toward the abrupt.  <br>
<br>
“Excuse me?” Dreketh asked with equal sharpness.<br>
<br>
“Feirral’s Chalice.  The Cup of Ages!” Widdlethorp explained.  “Who discovered it?”<br>
<br>
A look passed between the two young women.<br>
<br>
“Who says anyone has?” Laera asked slowly.  “As far as we know, part of our task is to find its location.”<br>
<br>
“Noooo, no, no, no…” The Gnome shook his head.  “Your gods would never declare the Pact without at least one of them knowin’ its whereabouts.  Why do you think they waited so many years before takin’ action?  C’mon, fess up.  Somebody knows.”<br>
<br>
Laera, her hands idly petting Widdlethorp’s dog in her lap, made another glance up at her companion.  Dreketh merely shook her head with serious mien.<br>
<br>
“Neither of us know, Dathan,” Laera said with confidence.<br>
<br>
“You mean neither of you were told.  Hmm, most peculiar,” the Gnome said thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
“You would be surprised at the number of things we haven’t been told,” Dreketh muttered, pacing about the Gnome’s living room with a languid step.<br>
<br>
“What things?” Widdlethorp asked with interest.<br>
<br>
“Well, what we’re supposed to do, for starters,” Laera said spitefully.  “Why we’ve been brought together, where we’re to go.  We didn’t even know who Zeranon was until we came across his name in your article at the library in Erudin.”<br>
<br>
“Wait, wait, wait,” the wizard shook his hands in the air, forestalling anything else the druid might say.  “’Why you have been brought together?’  You’re tellin’ me you two haven’t been raised together from birth?”<br>
<br>
Both young women slowly shook their heads.  Absurdly blank looks graced both their features, as they cast each other yet another unknowing glance.<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp’s jaw hung limply from his mouth.  The wizard looked for all the world as if he were being confronted by a rainbow-colored dragon asking for directions to the nearest bath house.  A confused jumble of words escaped his mouth as he tried to reason things out in his head.<br>
<br>
“How are- what- what did- what- when… when!” he insisted.  “When did you two meet?  How long have you been travelin’ together?”<br>
<br>
“Well, I don’t know for sure,” Laera answered, considering the weeks that have gone by since first meeting Dreketh at the Tunnel of Ro.  “We met in early autumn.  A few months or so, I suppose?”  The Wood Elf looked over to her companion, seeking help.<br>
<br>
“About that,” Dreketh confirmed with a nod.<br>
<br>
The elderly Gnome collapsed into his chair with an astounded gasp.  “A few months!” he whispered in disbelief.  The pallor on the small man’s face made him seem to age years right there before the two women.<br>
<br>
“Are you okay?” Laera asked, her voice concerned.<br>
<br>
“Just-just…. Shhh!” Widdlethorp responded irritably, waving his hands.  <br>
<br>
None of this made any sense!  Widdlethorp had always assumed that the selected advocates would have been sent off to grow up in some isolated region of Norrath, away from the racial biases of civilization.  It was the obvious thing to do.  To find that things had developed differently alarmed the old Gnome.  What were the gods up to?<br>
<br>
Only one possibility presented itself.  The wizard’s suspicious eyes looked over at his two guests, sizing them up silently.  He had to know if it could be true.<br>
<br>
“Have you both-“ he began, then checked himself.  “How… much do you know about the Pact of Zeranon, anyway?  I’ll not waste my time repeatin’ words.”<br>
<br>
Laera continued stroking the dog’s soft fur between her fingers, her face downcast, leaving Dreketh to answer the Gnome’s question.<br>
<br>
“Just what you wrote in your article,” the Dark Elf said quietly.  “We know Zeranon was a powerful necromancer who declared war on the gods themselves.  Using the Cup of Ages to obtain their blood, he captured their power into himself.  With every victory he drank from the Chalice, growing stronger until one day Erollisi Marr beguiled him into his own defeat.”<br>
<br>
The Gnome waved a dismissing hand.  “All that is about Feirral.  What do you know of the Pact?”<br>
<br>
“Not much,” the Dark Elf admitted.  “Only that we are to stay at each other’s side, never to be parted for very long.”  Dreketh looked down at the top of the Wood Elf’s head.  “That… and we are to defend each other’s lives with our own.”<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp continued staring at the shadow knight, his expression expectant as if more was forthcoming.  Dreketh returned the Gnome’s gaze blankly, her mouth closed.  Moments passed before the wizard began to realize she had nothing more to say.<br>
<br>
“That’s it?” he asked.<br>
<br>
Dreketh closed her eyes and nodded slowly.<br>
<br>
Light dawned in the little man’s eyes as small bouts of laughter escaped his throat.  Gleeful giggles turned to hilarity as Widdlethorp covered his eyes, laughing as if nothing on Norrath that had ever given him so much amusement.  Laera, Dreketh, even the dog stared at the wizard as if he'd gone mad.<br>
<br>
“Well done,” he said, catching his breath.  “Very well done indeed, you two!”<br>
<br>
“Who, us?” Laera asked, her tone losing its amiable quality.<br>
<br>
“No, not you!” Widdlethorp flapped his small hand at the Wood Elf.  Hopping down from his seat, the Gnome spread his arms wide.  “Tunare, carin’ Mother!”  He turned a finger toward the Dreketh.  “And Innoruuk, hateful Prince!  They have actually come to a meetin’ of the minds, such that they might actually succeeded in thwartin’ the designs of Erollisi Marr.  Unbelievable.  Simply unbelievable.”  Widdlethorp held his hands up, as if such a statement was beyond argument.<br>
<br>
“What are you saying?” Dreketh asked suspiciously.<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp grabbed hold of his ribs.  “Oh, I’m… I’m sorry,” he said, gasping.  “I really shouldn’t laugh at your situation.  It’s not polite, and it’s very unhealthy for a man my age…” The Gnome doubled over, holding his sides as if he might burst.<br>
<br>
“Well, why don’t you fill us in on our situation, so we can appreciate the joke?”  Dreketh folded her arms again, taking on a bothered stance.<br>
<br>
The old Gnome staggered his way back to his seat with a sigh gracing his mirthful grin.  “Oh, my dear inkie.  I don’t even know where to begin.  I’m afraid you two have been duped by the very hands that brought you together.”<br>
<br>
“Meaning what?” Laera asked, her voice sharp.  The normally patient Wood Elf was beginning to grow tired of being left out of things everyone seemed to know, but weren’t telling.<br>
<br>
“Oh, me,” the Gnome said with a sigh, collecting himself.  “I suppose it would be best to start where you left off in Feirral’s little story.”<br>
<br>
Both shadow knight and druid paid the old wizard their rapt attention.  The time had finally come.<br>
<br>
“Yes, Feirral Zeranon was a necromancer and an Erudite by birth,” Widdlethorp began.  “He did defeat deity after deity until there were only a handful left to stand against him.  I know because I helped him to do it.”<br>
<br>
A look of alarm crossed Laera’s face.  Looking to her companion, she found Dreketh standing quietly with a grim expression aimed at the Gnome as he continued his story.<br>
<br>
“You see, no matter how much power he accumulates in even a hundred lifetimes, a necromancer can never walk the planes freely on his own.”  A glimmer of pride entered the Gnome’s voice.  “Never, that is, without a wizard by his side.<br>
<br>
“At the risk of conceit, I was quite the caster in my time,” Widdlethorp went on, playfully examining his fingernails as he spoke.  “Bein’ a prominent wizard, I had somethin’ Feirral desperately needed in order to further his plans.  So, he sought me out and made me an offer no wizard could refuse.  The deal was that I would agree to ferry him around the immortal planes and keep my mouth shut about what I saw.  In return, he would grant me what every spell caster on Norrath would sell his soul for… immortality.<br>
<br>
“Bein’ the young and stupid imbecile I was, I leapt at the opportunity.  The rules were that, barrin’ illness or injury, I would never die.  If I knew then what I know now…” Widdlethorp shook his head sadly.  “But that’s another discussion.<br>
<br>
“Anyway, it’s true Feirral was defeated by the combined charms of the Queen of Love and his own overactive libido.  But his legacy lived on even after death.  Fearin’ defeat by the covetous hands of Tunare and Innoruuk, Erollisi Marr stashed the Chalice inside Her vault and hid it away here on Norrath where they could not reach it.  And here it has stayed – somewhere – for almost two thousand years.”<br>
<br>
“Why didn’t Erollisi Marr simply destroy the Chalice when she had the chance?” Laera asked, her face full of intrigue.  “She’s a goddess, after all.  I would think that would be the first thing she did.”<br>
<br>
“She is a goddess,” Widdlethorp confirmed.  “But She couldn’t destroy the Chalice.  No, sir!”<br>
<br>
“Why not?” the Wood Elf pressed.<br>
<br>
“Because only one who drinks from the Cup of Ages may destroy it,” the old Gnome explained.  “The Queen of Love feared Feirral’s Chalice even more than reprisal by the principal gods’ power.  She feared what She might become, and the consequences to all should She drink of it.  Her own abeyance ensured that She could not destroy the Chalice Herself, nor could any other deity for that matter.  Her only option was to hide it away from covetous hands – Her own included.  Therefore, She sealed it inside Her vault in a manner even She cannot breach, and sent it away here to Norrath for safe keepin’.”<br>
<br>
“We know all that,” Dreketh said impatiently.  “So now someone has discovered this vault and our gods are trying to make a grab for it, is that it?”<br>
<br>
“A most enthusiastic grab, yes,” the Gnome chuckled.<br>
<br>
“So, why have us go after it?” the Dark Elf gestured to Laera and herself.  “Why not come to Norrath themselves, break open the vault, and take possession with their own hands?”<br>
<br>
“Now, lemme finish!” Widdlethorp snapped.  “Like the Queen of Love, neither Tunare nor Innoruuk can open the vault themselves – it’s not how the vault works.  Only their disciples have the power to unseal the Chalice.  And even then it cannot be done individually.<br>
<br>
“Erollisi Marr constructed the vault in a very clever way.  Simply bestowin’ the vault with wards imbued to the fullest extent of Her power was not enough.  As their power and authority were superior to the Queen’s, Tunare and Innoruuk could always transcend Her will with their own.  Instead, She set forth a divine mandate of Love.  Within Her own bounds as the Queen of Love, She declared that only under the precepts of love shall the Chalice be unsealed.<br>
<br>
“Not your average love, mind you.”  Widdlethorp wagged a finger at his audience.  “There are two stages involved in openin’ the vault.  First, it is surrounded by a divine aura, and may only be approached by one possessin’ the holy power of Tunare.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s mouth opened, her spine tingling.<br>
<br>
“Second is the door itself,” the Gnome continued.  “It contains no keyhole or handle, yet may be opened nonetheless.  But only by the Touch bestowed a shadow knight of Innoruuk.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh stood immobile, her own destiny realized.  It certainly explained why Kella N’Threk had demanded she renounce necromancy in favor of becoming a shadow knight.<br>
<br>
“Congratulations,” Widdlethorp said, thrusting two pudgy fingers at the women before him.  “You two are to have the honor of unsealin’ the most obscure treasure of all – the Cup of Ages!”<br>
<br>
Aghast, Laera looked to Dreketh across the room.  Standing grimly, the shadow knight remained outwardly unaffected by the Gnome’s grandiose words.<br>
<br>
“You said that only by the precepts of love would the Chalice be unsealed,” she said indifferently.  “How is this fulfilling that mandate?”<br>
<br>
“Think about it,” Widdlethorp replied with a gleam in his eye.  “To pull this off, you both are goin’ to have to trust the other implicitly.”  The wizard gestured to Laera.  “You, my dear, must trust that once you escort your Dark Elf friend through the divine curtain and back, that she will not simply kill you and hand the Chalice over to her god.”  The wizard made a similar gesture to Dreketh.  “Once you have spent your power to unseal the vault, you must trust that your partner won’t kill you and escape before you can take possession of the Chalice.<br>
<br>
“Whatever paltry treaties or agreements that can be struck between the followers of light and dark on paper, what it all boils down to is trust – trust of one’s own life and limb, the trust of one’s own god placed in the hands of a mortal enemy.  Such trust must be absolute.  It goes far beyond simple empathy or friendship.  If there is any doubt as to what I am sayin’, then ponder this,” Widdlethorp leaned forward in his seat, his voice a piercing whisper.  “Betrayal would mean the highest exaltation to the one who delivers the chalice into the hands of her god, and would surely spell the subsequent doom of the other and her race for all eternity.”<br>
<br>
A clock on the wall ticked away the seconds as Widdlethorp allowed the two young women a moment to digest his words.  <br>
<br>
“That kind of trust does not happen between mere friends, or even family,” the Gnome said, breaking the silence.  “It happens only between people who know each other’s very core.  Anythin’ less, and the Pact is defeated before it even begins.  It requires the singular bond of devoted love.  Without such an implicit bond, no sane person would agree to do it!  So ideally, the Chalice remains safely hidden away from reach.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh met the Wood Elf’s gaze, the two companions sizing each other up in a whole new light for the first time.  Together, both shadow knight and druid began to ask themselves very similar questions.  The wizard glanced between them, his mind reeling with the myriad of thoughts that must have been going through their minds.<br>
<br>
“I still don’t understand why us,” Dreketh said, her words aimed at the Gnome while her eyes remained focused on her companion.<br>
<br>
“Why not you?” Widdlethorp shrugged.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf rolled her eyes at the inane response – the very same comeback Master Xavier had given her when she asked that question of him.<br>
<br>
“I’ll tell you why not us,” she said, turning to confront the small wizard.  “I had to be transplanted from a profession I had grown fond of – even talented in – to become a shadow knight.”  Dreketh pointed to Laera sitting on the floor.  “She was practically robbed from the cradle in order to answer the call of this infernal Pact.  If we’re expected to unseal the Chalice and fight for its possession in some grand duel, then this quest is the stuff of legends, fit for skilled and trained followers of our gods.  My guild is filled to overflowing with dedicated shadow knights, while any disciple of Tunare would jump at the chance to defend Her claim on the Chalice.  Why pick us over them?”<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp’s expression turned condescending.  “Are you suggestin’ that a fully seasoned shadow knight of Innoruuk would ever once consider formin’ such a bond with an experienced clergy of Tunare?  Or vice-versa?  The radical step your gods took in movin’ forward this way was enough of a risk.  My guess is they knew they were on shaky ground to begin with, which is why your masters told you as little as they could get away with.”<br>
<br>
“Why?” Laera demanded, her face stern.  “What harm could it have done to tell us all this from the beginning?”<br>
<br>
“You tell me,” the Gnome said, meeting her challenge.  “If your priest had come to you sayin’ you were commanded to go out and form an intimate, trustin’ relationship with a Teir’Dal, who would hold your very life in the palm of her hand, how would you have reacted?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf tossed her head, not answering.  Widdlethorp turned his question toward Dreketh.<br>
<br>
“Or you?” he asked of the shadow knight.  “How would you have responded, knowin’ that a Wood Elf was about to become your confidant, trusted with your existence and the well-bein’ of your race?”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf was reluctant to answer at first.  “I’d have laughed my way out of the room,” she admitted grudgingly.<br>
<br>
“There, you see,” the wizard nodded.  “Disclosure of the facts would have meant certain failure.  Face up to it.  You were used and manipulated by those higher-ups who selected you for the Pact.  As you went about blindly seekin’ what it is you’re supposed to be doin’ out here, they were bettin’ that journeyin’ together – sharin’ hardships and conquerin’ the obstacles that stood in your way – would forge the bond they needed in order to unseal the Chalice.  You’re the pawns of authority and the play things of your gods, both of you.”<br>
<br>
In his own way, Widdlethorp actually seemed as though his sense of propriety was offended at how the two young Elves were being treated.  Individually, Dark Elf and Wood Elf both began to share his incense.<br>
<br>
“Now that it has all been played out for you, there is only one question left that holds any relevance,” the Gnome said, a smugness creeping into his voice.  “Do the two of you together have what it takes to finish the Pact?  If so, what are you goin’ to do with the Chalice once you get it?”<br>
<br>
Laera’s expression twisted.  “That’s two questions,” she said accusingly.<br>
<br>
“So, I’m a wizard, not a mathematician,” Widdlethorp shrugged.  “The point is, what happens next?  What does the future hold?  A certain Someone has already given you a clue.”<br>
<br>
The wizard was rewarded with blank looks from his guests.  Both figured the self-absorbed Gnome was referring to himself, but they were proven wrong.<br>
<br>
“The prophecy if Erollisi Marr,” the old man whispered with a gleeful wink.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="file:///storyline/storyIL.txt">Table of Contents</a><br>
<br>
<c "#FFff00">Chapter 20 - Desperate Measures</c><br>
<br>
“The tears of the slayer upon the brow of the slain shall herald the unsealing of the Cup of Ages.  Sundered light and shadow will be cast upon mortal soil, wielded in the hand of innocence.  And the whispered convergence of power will reign unleashed upon all lands of Norrath by privilege of its keeper.”<br>
<br>
Widdlethorp had quoted the prophecy for his two guests, word for word.  Dreketh found it suspiciously odd how the two thousand year old Gnome could recollect the words of the goddess so precisely, yet scratch his head over Zeranon’s last name.  Shrugging, the Dark Elf chalked it up to the selective memory of a senile old has-been.<br>
<br>
Laera didn’t care for old men or their half-baked memories.  Now all had become clear – not only in regards to the Pact itself, but also the conversation that had taken place between the head mistress and Yeolarn Bronzeleaf back in Felwithe.  The incident in Tunare’s temple had shaken the girl terribly at the time, and things had never been the same since that day.  The young druid slowly came to realize how mistaken she was in believing that she had been chosen by the Mother Herself to fulfill this mission.  Instead, it turned out to be a matter of her being in the right place at the right time – a worshipper of Tunare gullible enough to become a lamb to the slaughter.  No, the more time passed it became clear that she was more a disciple of convenience than devotion.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf wanted to march into Felwithe and give Yeolarn Bronzeleaf a piece of her mind.  Where once she reacted with timidity, Laera became indignant.  How dare he offhandedly cast her to the wolves like this?  How dare he treat her like some naïve child, when in fact she was his one hope for the future?  She may be nothing more than an instrument of his designs, like any sword he wielded to fulfill his duty, but every swordsman worth his salt knows you treat your valuable weapons with respect and care. <br>
<br>
What was it about Laera that made her superiors believe she would befriend the Teir’Dal, anyway?  Did they see flaws in her character that they intended to exploit?  The thought rubbed Laera the wrong way, though she couldn’t dismiss it.  The growing relationship she had with Dreketh was plain to see every time she looked at the Dark Elf – pointing to the conclusion that there may, indeed, be something wrong with her.<br>
<br>
But no, she told herself repeatedly.  Dreketh was no longer just some Teir’Dal to the druid.  Dreketh was Dreketh.  With all her faults, Laera had come to recognize numerous good points to be found in her partner, blue skin or no.  She had to admit, the shadow knight had taught her more than her share of streetwise habits, not to mention several advantages of showing muscle and brevity in the right situations.  She learned how strength of the body could prove every bit as valuable as strength of the spirit, and she doubted very much that lesson would ever be taught so well in Tunare’s school for Druidic Studies.<br>
<br>
Was there something wrong with her?  Seeing what she had already gained from journeying with Dreketh, Laera decided the question was moot.  So what if her superiors saw shortcomings?  The truth was she felt more confident about herself and her abilities since joining up with the shadow knight.  Those were good things, and she had Dreketh to thank for it – not her presumptuous, manipulative superiors.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s thoughts were not dissimilar.  The fool priest, Kella N’Threk, had been her puppet master all along.  She admitted that he never once gave a contrary impression to that, but to see it in this fashion galled her.  The old man was not as mad as he would have others believe.  He deceived and used her, and when she had deviated from the set course, she was beaten back into submission in true Teir’Dal fashion.  It made the Dark Elf wince to realize how her torture and exile meant nothing more than a simple tactic in some farcical game of chess between two gods thirsting for even more power than they already had.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf was as much a problem.  Memories of the mob she was forced to flee from in Nektulos returned to her with cries of “Elf lover” ringing through her ears.  Too closely it resembled an awful prelude to what Widdlethorp had just revealed about the Pact and the bond that must exist between she and Laera before it could be fulfilled.  Only by the precepts of love will the Chalice be unsealed.<br>
<br>
Dreketh had to admit, the druid’s manner after discovering her in the Tunnel of Ro had caught the cynical shadow knight by surprise.  Laera nurtured her back to health with a firm, but giving hand.  Had it been anyone else, Dreketh would have said it was due to the Pact, but she knew the Wood Elf well enough to tell it was more than that.  Laera truly cared that Dreketh felt pain.  She cared whether she, a Teir’Dal, lived or died.  The idea was completely outlandish and, frankly, amazing to the Dark Elf.  When she asked herself if she would have responded in kind, she actually felt ashamed.  Not only that, but the hard work the Wood Elf underwent to keep a roof over their heads for those long weeks of recuperation spoke volumes as well.  Often, Laera would hunt all hours of the day, from dawn to dusk, only to drag herself inside the house to attend Dreketh.  Not a single word of complaint escaped the druid’s lips, and not once did she allow herself to fall asleep before her patient.  <br>
<br>
To this day, the aggrieved shadow knight would often wake from a particularly horrific nightmare in search of the Wood Elf.  Inevitably, she would find Laera sleeping nearby, putting the Dark Elf’s sleep-dimmed fears to rest.  Sometimes her cries would disturb the druid’s sleep, but instead of rebuke, Laera would inevitably crawl out of bed to hold her hand, assuring her that she was still there.  During such moments, the tension that existed between them vanished without a trace as Laera whispered words of comfort to the distressed Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
“Elf lover!  Elf lover!  Elf lover!”  The cries of her people pounded inside the shadow knight’s head.  On some level, Dreketh couldn’t deny that she was becoming attached to the Wood Elf.  If nothing else, she owed Laera a great deal.  But what Dreketh did in the Pact, she did for her god and her people.  Her faith remained stalwart – if only she could make her people see the truth of it.  She was still of the blood, as the saying went.<br>
<br>
One thing was clear – Kella N’Threk was undoubtedly playing the Denizens of the Dead for fools as well.  If only it were possible to reach her father, Xon Quexill, and tell him of the priest’s actions.  Perhaps something could be done to set things right.  She could return home again, her name vindicated.  She could possibly even return to her studies of necromancy once the priest’s underhandedness was revealed.<br>
<br>
But how?  Nezzka Tolax, her current guild master, was firmly ensconced in Neriak with his own matters to attend to, and her father was likely still on sabbatical at points unknown.  Clearly, making contact with any Teir’Dal in authority was an impossible notion for a labeled traitor.<br>
<br>
Or was it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“We have to go to Clan Crushbone,” Dreketh said with finality as she walked.<br>
<br>
Laera’s stride remained uninterrupted at the Dark Elf’s sudden remark.  Having grown accustomed to Dreketh’s abruptness, she merely looked up from her own musings to give her companion a doubtful look.  “What are you talking about?”<br>
<br>
“I have to know what my people are doing,” Dreketh explained, ticking off her fingers as she continued.  “I have to know if an army is massing to meet the one here on Faydwer.  I have to know what is happening with my sect.  I have to know what Kella N’Threk is planning so I can know what to expect next.  With my exile, I can only do that at Crushbone.“<br>
<br>
The shadow knight looked to her companion, gauging her reaction.  Laera merely stared at the Dark Elf with a neutral expression as the two continued their journey out of Steamfont.<br>
<br>
“Crushbone,” said the druid.  Seeing Dreketh nod, she sought further confirmation.  “Clan Crushbone in Greater Faydark.”  The Dark Elf nodded again.  “Why in Tunare’s name would you want to go there?  It’s nothing but orcs.  How would you find these things out?”<br>
<br>
“Because…” Dreketh replied hesitantly.  Looking around briefly, the Dark Elf lowered her voice.  “Because there is a small Teir’Dal presence there.  A resident ambassador named D’Vinn.  He’s remote enough I don’t think he’ll have heard about the exile of a trainee shadow knight, but he would definitely know of a massing army if one exists.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s demeanor turned dark at hearing this news.  For years, Kelethin had struggled against the Crushbone horde, constantly at odds with the orcs living in Greater Faydark.  A number of times, the malevolent creatures had attempted to lay siege to the tree city.  Were it not for the steadfast alliance Kelethin held with the nearby High Elves of Felwithe, the city would certainly have fallen to orc rule decades ago.  The constant struggle against orcish hit-and-run tactics had taken its toll on the Wood Elf people, costing them much in the way of resources and liberties in their own lands.  Many had given their lives in the fight to keep the orcs at arm’s length.  And now, hearing that the Teir’Dal had a hand in all of it, while not surprising, was certainly displeasing to say the least.<br>
<br>
Rumors had, of course, been spoken about a few sporadic sightings of Dark Elves spotted near Crushbone during nighttime hours.  Upon investigation, however, nothing substantial could be found to support such claims.  Either the dastardly Dark Elves had eluded them in the misty darkness, or the sightings were ramblings of overtired imaginations.  Laera now knew it was the former.<br>
<br>
Laera spoke succinctly.  “Your people are trying to form an alliance with the Crushbone orcs.”  It was a statement, not a question.<br>
<br>
“The Teir’Dal seek allies where we can.”  Dreketh tilted her head with a small shrug.  “Even if it means climbing into bed with the more primitive factions of Norrath.”<br>
<br>
Laera bit her lip, containing her outrage.  Instead, she allowed herself to stare at her companion accusingly.  Dreketh caught sight of the Wood Elf’s glare, and drew herself up.<br>
<br>
“The Teir’Dal are few, and we have all of Norrath against us,” she said in defense of her race.<br>
<br>
“I can’t imagine why,” Laera interjected caustically, breaking her gaze.<br>
<br>
“You would do the same thing,” Dreketh pointed out.  “Anyone would, under the circumstances.  Crushbone would provide us with prime strategic value as a strangle point on two prime enemies on Faydwer.”<br>
<br>
“These are my people you’re talking about,” the Wood Elf growled.<br>
<br>
“I won’t apologize for the political maneuverings of my race,” Dreketh answered back.  “All I care about is the here and now, and right now it’s the only way to find out what Kella N’Threk is up to.  We have some heavy choices to make, and I don’t know about you, but I’d rather make an informed decision.”<br>
<br>
“I know,” Laera muttered, letting the matter drop.  “But you’re forgetting something.  The orcs hate Wood Elves almost as much as you do.  How am I supposed to get inside?”<br>
<br>
“That’s easy,” Dreketh replied.  “Same as Ak’Anon.  I run in, I talk to the ambassador, I leave a message to be sent by courier to my master at Neriak, and I come back out.”<br>
<br>
“It won’t work,” the Wood Elf said flatly.  “The camp outside Crushbone is little more than a war zone, day or night.  Even if I could get close enough to find a hiding place, the orcs would be sure to find me in the time it takes to do all that.  If I stayed a safe distance away, it would mean staying separated even longer, and you’d be in serious danger of being spotted.”<br>
<br>
“What about that camouflage thing you do?” the Dark Elf suggested.  “It makes you practically invisible.  You could stick with me and the orcs would never know you were there.”<br>
<br>
“The spell is too unstable,” Laera replied.  “It works well enough in the wilderness where there are plenty of places to hide if it fails, but not surrounded by a bunch of slavering orcs.”<br>
<br>
“Then I guess you’ve elected to become my personal slave again.  Congratulations,” Dreketh said with an evil grin.<br>
<br>
Laera returned the Dark Elf’s grin with a belittling grin of her own.  “A Wood Elf slave and her master roaming around in Greater Faydark?  I don’t think so.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh bristled at the druid’s tone, but had to admit she knew little of the situation in this place.  Seeing as how the forest was the Wood Elf’s homeland, she made her concession with a bothered sigh.<br>
<br>
“Then what do you suggest?” <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“You’re crazy,” Dreketh declared as she applied the pollen to her companion’s face.<br>
<br>
“We’re living in crazy times,” Laera replied, doing her best to keep her face still as marble.  “I told you before, if you can think of a better plan, I’m listening.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf shook her head, her mouth closed as she again dipped her dagger blade into the bowl resting in the grass beside her.  Normally, the blue pollen would be applied with a special instrument that makeup artists used to adorn the actors who portrayed Dark Elves on stage.  Having no such instrument handy, it was decided that Dreketh should use her dagger instead to apply the sticky film to the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
Laera did her best to maintain composure in the face of Dreketh waving the razor sharp weapon in front of her.  The shadow knight had already proven she kept a skilled and steady hand with the blade, so the nervous Wood Elf really had little to worry about.  Or so Laera told herself as she felt the dagger’s edge press against the tender skin of her face.  The dagger’s point slithered along her eyes, applying the blue substance to her lower eyelid.  One false move on the Dark Elf’s part, and the consequences would have been dire for the druid.<br>
<br>
“Talk about your implicit trust, huh?” Laera said with a nervous grin while Dreketh dipped the blade another time.<br>
<br>
“Yes, well,” The Dark Elf’s piercing eyes examined her work critically as she raised the dagger again.  “The question here isn’t trusting my intentions so much as it is my judgment, isn’t it?  The Pact-“<br>
<br>
“I have to blink!” Laera said urgently.  Dreketh immediately pulled back the dagger, allowing the Wood Elf to close her eyes with a growl.  “Some got in my eyes again.  I don’t know how they put up with this in the theater.  It burns.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh raised a self-deprecating eyebrow.  “They probably have people putting it on them who know what they’re doing.”  <br>
<br>
The Dark Elf watched as Laera blinked her eyes open, testing to see if the pain would cease.  With amazement, she saw how the tears escaping the druid’s eyelids rolled over the pollen in beads, rather than smudging the work she had already done.<br>
<br>
“Is this waterproof?” she asked, dabbing at the droplets with a small cloth from her pack.<br>
<br>
“Well, to a degree,” the Wood Elf replied.  Finding the burning gone, she leaned forward for Dreketh to resume.  “Once it dries, you can even touch it a little without it coming off.  But if it starts raining or someone decides to manhandle me, I’m in trouble.”<br>
<br>
“That shouldn’t be a problem,” Dreketh muttered, continuing her work.  “The orcs have no love for my kind, but they tend to leave us alone when we’re about.  You’re just going to have to keep your hands hidden, or we’re both dead.”<br>
<br>
Already, the Dark Elf had applied the pollen to Laera’s neck, shoulders, chest and upper arms – any place where skin was left exposed by her armor.  It quickly became apparent, however, that the small joints of the Wood Elf’s palm and fingers were going to be a problem.  As a solution, Dreketh pulled out a pair of extra gloves she carried with her for times when metal gauntlets proved too cumbersome to be practical.<br>
<br>
Laera’s striking auburn hair was going to be a problem as well.  It was commonly known that all Dark Elves had white hair – without exception.  It was a defining attribute of the race, and there was simply no believable means of explaining a dark-haired Teir’Dal.  The notion of finding a Dark Elf-crafted helm or hat anywhere on Faydwer was, in a word, absurd.<br>
<br>
“What do the actors use on stage?” Dreketh asked as she put the final touches on the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
“Wigs specially made from High Elf hair by artisans.  Hair that white is rare and expensive, though, so the wigs are highly valued,“ Laera replied.  Keeping her face motionless, she glanced at the Dark Elf’s hair. “It’s a very close likeness, though.  I think we could pull it off, but they’re kept stashed away in the Songweavers’ guild.  I couldn’t just walk up to them and ask to borrow one.”<br>
<br>
“Too bad you weren’t born a rogue,” Dreketh commented, sitting back.  “There.  Minus the hair, your own mother wouldn’t recognize you for a Wood Elf.”<br>
<br>
“I look good?” Laera asked hopefully.<br>
<br>
Dreketh tilted her head to see the druid from profile.  “Eh, not the most attractive inkie in history, but it’ll hold up to the casual observer.”<br>
<br>
“I beg your pardon?” Laera asked mockingly.  “Excuse me, but do my ears deceive me or did you just use the word ‘inkie?’ ”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf looked away, busying herself with cleaning her dagger.  “It was a jibe at the expense of a woodie, so it’s all right,” she said shortly, a half-smile escaping her control.<br>
<br>
“Is that so?”  Laera placed her hands on her hips, drawing herself up.  “Well, I’m going to prove to you that I will make a very believable inkie, thank you very much.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh merely looked up at the druid’s stately disposition, her smile unwavering.<br>
<br>
“Don’t believe me?” the blue-skinned Wood Elf asked.<br>
<br>
“Actually,” Dreketh said with a sigh, tossing aside the cloth she used to clean her weapon.  “I think you’ll make a convincing Dark Elf.”<br>
<br>
“Really?” Laera asked, an edge of excitement in her voice.<br>
<br>
Dreketh nodded.  “As long as you lay off the whole giggling and twirling around bit, you’ll be fine.”<br>
<br>
“I wouldn’t dream of it, dark sister.”  Crossing her arms and placing her palms against her chest, the would-be Dark Elf bowed her head, imitating the gesture Dreketh had taught her weeks ago in Erud’s Crossing.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets at seeing the solemn ritual of the vellin sar being performed in such a trivial manner.  Such a thing was unheard of for the gravely serious oath, and was never demeaned by any such display in Teir’Dal society.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight was about to rebuke her companion for such disrespect when something made her stop.  Despite the appearance of her skin, Laera was still a Wood Elf.  No matter what meeting of the minds she may have gained from traveling with a Dark Elf, she would probably never come to fully appreciate most Teir’Dal customs.  Knowing the druid as she did, she knew Laera would be contrite and sincerely apologetic for this infraction.  Laera would never intentionally show such a level of disrespect for something Dreketh held dear.<br>
<br>
What the hell, Dreketh thought with a shrug.  Like the Wood Elf said, they were living in crazy times.  It seemed fitting, somehow.  Bowing her head, Dreketh assumed the same position, palms placed against her own chest.  <br>
<br>
“Very good, young initiate,” she said, joining the charade.  “Very good, indeed.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hair was still a problem.  Even wearing a hooded cloak, Laera’s decidedly un-white hair had a way of peeking out from its hiding place, announcing to the world how her presumed heritage was a ruse.  Ideas were tossed back and forth by the two young women until it came down to one final option.<br>
<br>
“You’re crazy,” Dreketh commented for the seventh time that day as the winking lights of Kelethin started to appear high amid the treetops.  Dusk had arrived, causing the mists all through Greater Faydark to dim ominously around them.<br>
<br>
“You’ve made your opinion clear, Dreketh,” Laera replied, pulling off her gloves.  “Trust me, this is better.  The Songweavers’ guild house is just a short walk from the lift.  I’ll be in and out before you know I’m gone.”<br>
<br>
“The whole point of this disguise is to keep us from separating,” the Dark Elf said, folding her arms.<br>
<br>
“Well, if you’d let me cast the camouflage spell on you, we wouldn’t have to separate,” the druid pointed out.<br>
<br>
Dreketh blinked sullenly, looking up into the Wood Elf city.  The offer was tempting, considering the circumstances, but the shadow knight remained unyielding on the issue.  The thought of a light dweller’s power touching her, no matter how benevolent, still made her skin crawl.<br>
<br>
“Fine.  You’ll be safe here,” Laera said quickly.  Turning, she pointed off into the trees.  “The lift is just past that grove.  If anything goes wrong, you’ll see me running out from there.”<br>
<br>
“If anything goes wrong, I’ll be kissing a certain part of my anatomy goodbye. You really think this will work?” Dreketh asked skeptically.<br>
<br>
“Since the League of Antonican Bards started doing those mail runs, the Songweavers’ guild has been nothing but chaos with letters coming and going at all hours,” the Wood Elf said, handing the soft leather gloves to her partner.  “If I’m lucky, I’ll be able to sneak past everyone into the prop closet.  One way or another, I’ll see you soon – wig in hand.  I promise”<br>
<br>
Laera started walking in the direction she indicated when her companion’s voice halted her.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” Dreketh said, clearing her throat.  “Be-… quick about things.  I don’t like it out here.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s thin blue lips twisted in a grin.  “Trust me,” she mouthed as she turned again to rush off into the mist.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ever since Steamfont, Dreketh hadn’t seemed herself.  Though not exactly the talkative type, the Dark Elf was more reclusive than normal.  Laera couldn’t imagine why, unless it had something to do with seeing a Wood Elf masquerading in Teir’Dal skin.  Though not impossible, Laera had a nagging feeling that wasn’t it.<br>
<br>
From the gathering mists of night emerged an enormous mechanical lift – the very lift Laera had left as she departed her home months ago.  Looking up, she silently reveled at the sight of the wooden planks and buildings cradled high in the trees’ mighty limbs.  A rush of emotion hit her, her throat constricting as the sights, sounds and even smells of her home washed over her.  Everything was just as she remembered it.<br>
<br>
“Halt there!” cried a metallic voice.  Expecting this, Laera froze in place as the guard on duty approached, sword ready.  Seeing the druid’s blue skin and contradictory hair, the steel clad soldier appeared confused.  “What… manner of creature are you?”<br>
<br>
Laera cast the guard a winning smile with a self-conscious laugh.  Taking a deep breath, she launched into the spiel she’d practiced en route.  <br>
<br>
“I know how this must look.  It’s so embarrassing,” she said, covering her face.  “You see, I’m cast in the Ak’Anon production of ‘Darkness Spurned’ as Lady Morgalla D’Thren.  We arrived at Ak’Anon and got all ready to go on stage for the dress rehearsal when Wardrobe suddenly discovered they were short Dark Elf wigs by one.  So naturally, guess who they sent running back here to get hers?”  Laera held out her hands, shrugging.  “I know, I was outraged, too.  I mean, Mistress Nye is such a lesser role, why not send her out to fetch her wig instead of me?  Well, the director is just downright anal when it comes to having his leading lady picture-perfect.  It so turns out that there was one particular wig he had made just for this role – he paid for it out of his own pocket, can you believe that?  Anyway, he was going to throw one of his legendary fits if it wasn’t worn by Lady Morgalla, so I offered to make a quick trip back to retrieve it, since the stage crew had their hands full trying to set up a fifty-foot-wide stage in a twenty-foot-deep alcove with at least a dozen Gnome engineers running around, telling them how to get it to fit.”  Her lungs having run out of air, Laera took a deep breath.  “So, it’s kind of a crisis, as you can see.  I really need to get to the Songweavers’ and grab that wig before too many other people see me like this…” With a pleading expression, Laera held out her arms and hands, showing where the pollen ended and her true skin color began.<br>
<br>
The guard’s eyes blinked from behind the enclosed helm he wore, trying to assimilate the Wood Elf’s frantic explanation.  “Uh… okay, fine.  Go on ahead.  Just be careful up there – we don’t want anyone mistaking you for the real thing.  With war coming, things are tense enough around here.”<br>
<br>
Bobbing her head gratefully, Laera spoke a quick word of thanks and ran hastily up the ramp to stand on the lift.  With the pull of a lever the mechanism activated, hoisting her steadily higher into the trees.  Seeing the guards fall out of sight, the Wood Elf habitually raised a hand to wipe her forehead when she remembered the pollen.  Wincing, she lowered her arm and waited impatiently for the lift to deliver her to her destination above.<br>
<br>
Any elation she might have felt at returning to the city after so long was lost in a mass of excitement and urgency.  She’d made it over the first hurdle.  Now the challenging part was about to present itself as she tried to sneak, talk or charm her way through the Songweavers’ guild.<br>
<br>
Her arrival at the top of the lift was uneventful.  Though several passersby cast confused looks at her unusual appearance, she chose to ignore them.  Treading carefully, she crossed a creaking wooden bridge to arrive at the guild house on a neighboring platform.<br>
<br>
As she expected, things were calming down as night closed in, while all was alight inside the Songweavers’ guild.  The wooden doors sat propped open to the evening air as a tumultuous stream of voices wafted its way from the building.  Noise from a myriad of musical instruments stepped on each other’s toes, apparently warming up for one of the many recitals the bards held nightly.  The chaotic sound brought vivid memories back to the druid’s mind, remembering her days of childhood when she would visit such performances with Rigel.<br>
<br>
Peeking inside the doorway, Laera found a number of young students wailing away on their various instruments, fitting in a few stolen moments of practice before the big show began.  The druid grinned to herself, remembering what it was like to be young and in school, learning the secrets of her trade for the first time.  The smile quickly vanished however as she reflected on how simple the lives of these young musicians must be – how simple her life might have been had she not chosen to become a druid of Tunare.<br>
<br>
“Esscuse me,” a glib voice spoke from behind, making her jump.  “Can I hep you?”<br>
<br>
Laera turned around to find a lithe Half Elf male standing behind her.  At least, he looked male.  Her mind raced furiously to think of what to say when the dainty young man sporting a meticulous goatee caught sight of the druid’s skin.  Seeing his eyes grow large, Laera made a rattled attempt to explain her appearance when he interrupted her.<br>
<br>
“My dear girl, what in Tunare’s green world are you doing here looking like that?” he said, his eyes riveted to her skin.<br>
<br>
“Well… well, I-“ she began.<br>
<br>
“Nunno!” the Half Elf held up a silencing hand.  “Don’ tell me.  It was Gershy, wunnit?  I keep telling that boy to focus on the faerie bosoms and leave the inkies to me, but he never listens!  How long did he spen’ on this botch job, hmm?  Come on and tell Divaran, sweetie.”<br>
<br>
“I-I was just… I don’t-“<br>
<br>
“Oh, sweet thing,” he continued, placing a gentle hand to her shoulder.  “You’ve been traumatized, I can see that already.  Don’ worry, dear.  Divaran’s here to make it right for you.  Nobody would ever ask you to perform unner these conditions- silence!” the Wood Elf screeched, interrupting himself.  He waved a flippant hand toward the musicians inside.  “How’dyu  esspect an artiste to hear hisself think with all that racket?  Save it for the program, babies!  Save it!”<br>
<br>
The children looked at each other confusedly, but Divaran’s words had the desired effect – they stopped playing.  Grasping Laera’s limp hand in his own, the dainty Wood Elf took her inside the guild house, leading her through the main chamber.  Once inside, nobody seemed to think her appearance was the least bit odd.<br>
<br>
“You would not believe the things I put up with to bring this thing together,” he said conversationally, heading through a backroom door.  Inside were numerous people busy at work, all apparently getting ready for a show.  “The score changed twice today already, the choreographer has the grace of a one-legged Dwarf, and now I have Gershy’s ailing hand to cope with.  But like everything else aroun’ this place, it’s all about the essperience, innit?”<br>
<br>
Divaran plopped Laera down onto a tall wooden stool resting before a table laden with an assortment of cosmetics.  Small jars and dishes filled with various colors sat haphazardly amidst a collection of brushes and other exotic tools.  All was confusion throughout the room as unnamed voices called out to each other, while one distant voice rose above them all announcing that there was exactly one hour left before show time.<br>
<br>
The confused druid looked around to find she was already under Divaran’s close scrutiny.<br>
<br>
“Hmm,” he said with a critical eye.  “The shoulders aren’ bad.  An’ the arms, too.  Gershy’s not as bad as I thought.  But the face is simply atrocious!  A blind Ogre with a paintbrush could do better.  Now hold still for me, sweetie.”<br>
<br>
Quick as lightning, the self-stylized artiste grabbed a toning brush and set to work, lining the druid’s face with shades of blue and gray that, according to the praise he gave himself, far better suited the shape of her face.  Using a sponge-like implement, he dabbed and streaked the pollen across her cheeks as a master painter would create a prize work of art.  Accustomed to Dreketh’s slow, fastidious hand , Laera was unnerved at the speed and seeming lack of care Divaran went about his work.  Yet she felt his confidence with every twist and stroke he made with the brush.<br>
<br>
“Sweet thing,” he said casually as he applied the black eyeliner with a light touch.  “When I am done with you, Gershy will see essactly the difference between true art and jus’ painting someone pretty colors!  Hol’ still one minute an’ let this dry, I’ll be righ’ back.”<br>
<br>
Laera wondered about Dreketh standing all alone at the forest floor.  She left her companion in a relatively deserted area, but she also hadn’t intended on staying this long.  She didn’t know exactly how much time had passed, but she certainly expected to have been long gone by now.  Groaning, the druid imagined the earful she was about to receive when she returned.<br>
<br>
A heavy weight pressed against her head.  Obeying her knee-jerk impulse, she started to pull away.<br>
<br>
“Nunno, sweet thing!  Don’ move, I tol’ you!” Divaran said testily.<br>
<br>
A thick mass of white obscured Laera’s vision for a moment as the doting makeup artist placed a wig on her head.  Realizing her prize had just been handed to her on a silver platter, the druid held perfectly still, allowing Divaran to primp and tuck her hair beneath the wig with his usual gifted skill.<br>
<br>
“There, less take a look atchu,” Divaran said, turning her around on the stool.  “Hmm, I dunno.  Whaddyu think?” he asked, holding up a sheet of polished silver.<br>
<br>
Taking the mirror in hand, Laera’s breath caught in her throat.  What she saw was literally a Teir’Dal face – white hair and all – staring back at her.  Turning her head to the side, she could see how the skilled Wood Elf applied highlights to her cheekbones and chin, lending the pollen’s natural blue color a sense of realism that closely matched the contours of her face.  Craning her head, she could see the same technique used on her neck muscles and collarbones, bringing them out.  Even her eyes were expertly done, made up in such an exotic way she imagined Dark Elves would do on special occasions.  If she met herself walking down a pathway, Laera thought, she would never recognize herself.<br>
<br>
“Amazing…” she whispered.<br>
<br>
“Of course,” Divaran sniffed.  “It’s whatchu get when you know where to look for the talen’.”  Placing a hand on his chin, the artist raised an eyebrow.  “Now, about your outfit…”<br>
<br>
Laera looked down at the leather tunic.  “What?”<br>
<br>
“What?  Whatchu mean ‘what?’” he piped, waving his arms.  “Thassa druid symbol for druids!  There’s no inkie druids, don’ you know that?  Who gave you this to wear, hmm?  Hmm?  Tell me.”<br>
<br>
“Uh-“<br>
<br>
“No!  Nunno!”  Divaran raised his silencing hand.  “I just haff to get something else to wear for you.  I just wan’ to know why it is I who always ends up doing everybody’s job ‘round here!”  As the agitated Half Elf spoke, his voice rose louder and louder until he was addressing everyone in the room.  Accustomed to the eccentric Divaran’s tirades, everybody within earshot muttered and nodded at this grave injustice of his as they went about their business.<br>
<br>
“It’s mine,” Laera said timidly.<br>
<br>
“S’okay, s’okay,” Divaran replied, waving his hand.  “Jus’ get rid of it, and I’ll be back with something fitting.  Size five, right?”<br>
<br>
“Well, yes, I-“ Laera replied, but the Half Elf – confident in his own practiced judgment – had already bustled off into the crowd to fetch her costume.<br>
<br>
Glancing around at the mayhem all about, Laera considered staying to see what sort of costume Divaran dug up for her, thinking perhaps some Teir’Dal garb might come in useful.  But seeing how her time was short, and how her habit of not wearing anything beneath the tunic might prove embarrassing, the druid figured she had better quit while she was ahead.  She had what she came for, and this may be her only time to slip out unnoticed by her personal “artiste.”<br>
<br>
Slipping down off the stool, the new-and-improved “Dark Elf” padded through the crowd and made her way quietly out of the guild house.<br>
<br>
Laera considered using her magic to camouflage herself on the way to the lift.  After all that had happened already, she seriously wished to avoid further confrontations with anyone – especially looking the way she did.  On the other hand, casting the spell caused a lot of hubbub and would definitely attract undue attention.  How would it look if someone found a Teir’Dal inside the city using such a spell?  Likely, the area would quickly be flooded with spell casters using their magical sight to locate the intruder, causing even more unwanted attention.<br>
<br>
No, the evening had closed in and the people traveling the bridges in the darkness were sparse.  Laera decided to just keep a careful eye out for anyone who might see her.  It was only a short distance to the lift, anyway.<br>
<br>
Quiet as a mouse, Laera kept to the shadows as she made her way across the bridge.  She could hear a few garbled voices off in the distance, and so stole over the platform with hurried steps in case they were headed her way.  Looking around quickly to be certain she wasn’t discovered, the druid stepped onto the lift and released the mechanism, allowing it to lower to the ground.<br>
<br>
Laera breathed a sigh of relief – she made it.  The only thing left was the guard down at the bottom, but he knew she was in a hurry anyway.  She would probably have to make a show of her new white hair for a moment or two, but that was-<br>
<br>
The druid’s heart leaped into her throat.  Ducking low, she crawled to the lift’s edge to peer down at the forest floor rising to meet her.  What she saw nearly caused her to choke.  Before her was spread a mass of Wood Elf soldiers, all milling about at the foot of the lift.  Their voices rose noisily through the air as they waited – probably a scouting party just returned from their watch in the forest, Laera figured.<br>
<br>
Looking every which way, the disguised druid cast about helplessly trying to think of what to do.  As soon as she arrived at the ramp below, she would suddenly be a Teir’Dal surrounded by twenty or so Wood Elf soldiers.  True, the guard was probably still down there, and she could prove her identity by showing them her hands, but that would take time and hassle she couldn’t afford.<br>
<br>
Her only route of escape was the enormous arm leading into the mechanism itself that raised and lowered the lift.  Gazing hesitantly into the complex machinery only a Gnome could fully understand, Laera quickly decided that was her only option.  The mechanism was attached to the massive tree trunk, and would provide decent cover until the lift arrived at the ground, where she could hopefully spirit herself away into the woods without being seen.<br>
<br>
Without a second thought, Laera ran across the arm and ducked between a rolling gear and the tree trunk itself.  Crouching, the druid waited for the lift’s cycle to end.<br>
<br>
The cluttered voices grew louder the closer to the ground she came.  Tilting her head, she tried to make out the words, but the conversations were a conundrum of incoherent gibberish.  Soon, the mechanism lurched to a halt, having dutifully reached the ramp below.  The gigantic gear next to Laera shuddered to a stop and the Wood Elf peeked around it to see a number of the scouting party boarding the lift.<br>
<br>
It was now or never.  Scampering through a complex system of gears, wheels and cogs, Laera squirmed her way through the machine to fall silently on the ground, her nimble legs absorbing the impact.  Looking cautiously toward the ramp, she found it effectively concealed her from any prying eyes.<br>
<br>
“Piece of cake,” she whispered, satisfied.  “Who needs rogues to pull off a good caper?”<br>
<br>
Deciding it was best not to rest on her laurels for too long, Laera dashed into the trees with the skill of a young girl sneaking out of her parents’ house for the night.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“Dreketh!” the druid called out in a piercing whisper.  “Dreketh, it’s me.  Come out and let’s go.”<br>
<br>
No answer.  Laera was certain this was where she had left her companion, but now there was no sign of the Dark Elf anywhere. The leaf-covered ground revealed no footprints or any sign of a struggle, but that was little comfort to the Wood Elf.  Fearing the worst, she began to look deeper into the mists hoping perhaps Dreketh had become bored and wandered off a short distance.<br>
<br>
“Where have you been?” a voice growled from behind, causing the already tense druid to jump.<br>
<br>
Clutching her chest, Laera whirled around.  “Don’t do that!” she said, shoving angrily at the Dark Elf.  “You almost gave me a heart attack!”<br>
<br>
“You?” Dreketh asked incredulously.  “Thanks to your evening stroll through your little tree house city, I was almost found by a patrol… that… came…” The Dark Elf’s words slowed to a stop, her eyes on Laera’s face.  “You look different.”<br>
<br>
“Uh,” Laera reached up and touched her face.  “It must be the wig.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf’s eyes narrowed as she leaned in closer.  “No, your eyes are done and your cheeks look different,” she declared suspiciously, looking down.  “And look at your shoulders!  What the hell have you been doing up there?  I told you the job we did would be fine for orcs.”<br>
<br>
“It couldn’t be helped,” the Wood Elf sighed.  “One of the makeup artists in the guild saw me and his sense of aesthetics was offended.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, thank you very much,” Dreketh said caustically, her arms folded.<br>
<br>
“He was a total nutcase,” Laera said quickly.  “I couldn’t get away until he left to get my wardrobe.  Now can we get out of here before we-“<br>
<br>
“Laera?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s features froze, a chill running up her spine.  She recognized that voice.  She must have heard it speak her name a thousand times as an acolyte.  Turning, Laera faced the voice’s owner with a hunted look.<br>
<br>
“Laera!  It really is you,” Rigel said, standing before her dressed head to toe in footman’s leather.  “I thought I recognized the tunic, but I wasn’t sure until I heard your voice.”<br>
<br>
Laera merely stared at her long time friend, her expression petrified.<br>
<br>
Rigel cleared his throat, looking her up and down.  “What’s… what’s going on, Lae?” he asked uncertainly.  The druid looked for all the world like she had just been caught with her hand in the cookie jar.  He jutted his chin toward Dreketh.  “Who is this, and why are you running around looking like that?”<br>
<br>
“Rigel…” Laera swallowed, wetting her suddenly dry throat.  “Did… did anyone else see me?”<br>
<br>
“Well no, I-“<br>
<br>
“Dreketh, don’t!” Laera cried, but she was too late.<br>
<br>
In one swift movement, the Dark Elf had drawn her sword and approached the young druid acolyte, her blade raised to his throat.<br>
<br>
“Quiet!” she barked at the druid, though it was clear by her expression that the command was meant for Rigel as well.  “We’ve been found out,” she said more calmly, glaring directly at this unknown Wood Elf before her.  <br>
<br>
“Dreketh, stop,” Laera pleaded.  “This is Rigel, the one I told you-“<br>
<br>
“I don’t care who it is,” Dreketh said menacingly.  “He was with that patrol that went by here.  If they weren’t such inattentive fools, I’d be decorating their blades with my innards right now.”<br>
<br>
Rigel’s stunned features turned toward Laera, his mouth hanging open silently.  The druid returned the acolyte’s look with another pleading gaze of her own.<br>
<br>
“Please, Dreketh,” she argued, placing a hand on the shadow knight’s shoulder.  “He won’t tell anyone.”<br>
<br>
Rigel’s gaze turned back to Dreketh, his mouth closing as he realized that this was no make up job standing before him, as was Laera.  Looking into the Dark Elf’s azure eyes, Rigel’s shocked appearance transformed darkly.<br>
<br>
“Tell anyone what?” he asked calmly.  “That there is a Teir’Dal spy in the forest?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh pressed the blade harder against her captive’s throat.  “Open your mouth again, and your words will end in your own blood, woodie,” she snarled.<br>
<br>
Heeding the shadow knight’s advice, Rigel looked once again at Laera, his eyes questioning and suspicious.<br>
<br>
A dozen fleeting thoughts ran through the druid’s mind as she desperately tried to come up with something to allay her companion.  “Dreketh, you can’t kill him,” she said, irresolute.  Then the answer came to her.  “If he doesn’t return to his scouting party, they’ll come looking for him.  All of them, you understand?”<br>
<br>
Seeing Dreketh’s resolve waver, Laera turned back to Rigel.  “What are you doing out here?  You’re supposed to be at the school!  It’s way after curfew!”<br>
<br>
Rigel cast the Dark Elf a grim look as he spoke.  “When the call to arms came from Felwithe after you left, a few of the acolytes were asked to volunteer to serve as scouting parties so the army could train.  We’re ordered to kill anything we find out here in blue skin,” he spat his words at Dreketh.<br>
<br>
“But what about-“ the druid began.<br>
<br>
“This is pointless!” Dreketh said through clenched teeth.  “We should already be halfway to Crushbone by now.  Any more delay and we’re both dead.”<br>
<br>
“You’re dead already, inkie!” Rigel snapped.  “Our army will march on Neriak and when we’re done exterminating every last one of you, the only thing left behind will be a trail of smoke above a liberated Nektulos Forest!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh pulled back to deliver a swing that would instantly decapitate the impudent Wood Elf, effectively silencing him before he brought down the whole city on them.  Tensing to deliver the killing blow, her arm was halted by the druid’s firm grip on her wrist.<br>
<br>
“No!” Laera cried.<br>
<br>
Seizing the moment, Rigel leapt back out of the shadow knight’s range as she struggled to fight off the druid’s interference.  Blinded by rage, Dreketh raised a gauntleted fist to deliver a full backhanded cuff across her companion’s face.  As soon she saw what she was about to do, however, the Dark Elf seized control of herself, checking the blow.<br>
<br>
Rigel had seen enough.  Now a relatively safe distance away from his attacker, he cried out an alarm.  “Inkie in the forest!  Inkie in the forest!”<br>
<br>
Looking at Rigel with panic in her eyes, Laera saw on his face a look of seething hatred for the Dark Elf as he clutched at his throat where her sword had been.  Even during the worst of times, she had never before seen such enmity on the young acolyte’s face.  Rigel looked at Dreketh as if she were no less than Innoruuk incarnate standing before him.<br>
<br>
“Rigel, no!  She mustn’t be killed!” she cried, much to his shock.  <br>
<br>
“What are you talking about?” Rigel answered indignantly.  “She’s a Teir’Dal in Greater Faydark!  What are you doing protecting her unless…” He hesitated, sudden comprehension crossing his face.  “Unless… you brought her here…”<br>
<br>
A myriad of voices emerged from behind the stunned acolyte, most of them calling for Rigel to keep shouting so they could locate him in the darkness.  But the young acolyte was too scandalized by his own words to call out a second time, his face a frozen mask of betrayal as he looked at his long time friend.  <br>
<br>
Hearing the distant voices, Dreketh roughly grabbed hold of the druid’s arm, practically dragging her away at a hurried pace.  “Now it’s a race to Crushbone,” she muttered, leaving the catatonic acolyte behind in the distance.  “You should have let me kill him!”<br>
<br>
“He’s my friend!” Laera shouted at her companion.<br>
<br>
“Shut your mouth and get moving,” Dreketh replied, letting go of the Wood Elf’s arm and giving her a shove forward.  Both young women broke into a run as the Dark Elf spoke.  “You know as well as I do what’s at stake here.  What’s more important, the Pact or your friend’s pathetic life?”<br>
<br>
Pumping her legs hard to keep up with the shadow knight, Laera snarled to give the obvious answer when the impact of Dreketh’s question suddenly struck her.  The Cup of Ages – ultimate power and rulership over all nations of Norrath.  Possibly the extinction of her entire race and others.  Was the life of any one person above that?  Or a hundred?  At one point in her life, the idealistic young acolyte within Laera would have answered yes without pause.  But now that the day of reckoning was nearly upon them, she wasn’t so sure.<br>
<br>
Biting her tongue, the druid redoubled her efforts to reach Clan Crushbone before her own people hunted her down and massacred them both in the name of her goddess.<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 21 - The Ambasador</c><br>
<br>
The lone ambassador sat quietly in the darkness of his quarters, a cool night breeze wafting through the window at his side.  Though the orcs of Crushbone considered the room to be lavish, rivaling even the emperor’s private chambers high in the tower of the castle – most Dark Elves would consider the room an insult for an emissary of Neriak.  However, through manipulation and diplomacy – two skills the ambassador prided himself in – D’Vinn managed to make the place not only livable, but quite comfortable in a simplistic way.<br>
<br>
His living space was one of the few comforts the ambassador afforded himself amid this den of uncivilized, uncultured toadies who called themselves orcs.  These boorish creatures holed up in a godforsaken vale at the edge of the world had very little to offer such a dignitary as he, and it showed.  The comforts of Neriak were a thousand miles away, and D’Vinn was reminded of it bitterly every day he awoke in his straw-mattress bed.<br>
<br>
It could be worse, he told himself repeatedly.  Far better than Ambassador K’Ryn’s lot in Oggok, stone city of the Ogres.  At least the stench surrounding orcs could be masked with perfumes and incense, of which D’Vinn always kept himself well stocked.<br>
<br>
It was a backwater assignment, to be sure.  From day one, D’Vinn never once believed a true alliance could be made between the Teir’Dal and Clan Crushbone.  The orcs of Crushbone were far too primitive to form any lasting relationship with Dark Elves, and possessed nothing of benefit to Neriak anyway.  <br>
<br>
Nothing, that is, except an ideal strategic position that would allow the Teir’Dal access to two blood enemies.  Both Elven cities of Felwithe and Kelethin lay virtually on Clan Crushbone’s doorstep, making it an ideal location for rallying a military strike on both cities.  Only two problems remained.  For one thing, the glade of Crushbone was isolated and landlocked with its only entrance being that of Greater Faydark.  To mass an army of Dark Elves in Crushbone would first mean sneaking soldiers past the enemies they were meant to attack.  The other problem was balance of power in the area.  The Teir’Dal held virtually no presence on the continent of Faydwer, nor did they have any sanctuary with the locals outside of Crushbone.  All things considered, any force they could mass in the vale would be token resistance at best.<br>
<br>
So why bother with an alliance in the first place?  D’Vinn smiled wickedly at the subtle genius of his race.  Reaching toward the end table sitting next to him, he poured himself another helping of wine into the fine crystal goblet he favored.  His grinning lips brushed the glass edge as he sampled the deep red liquid.<br>
<br>
A brutish knock sounded at his door, breaking the ambassador’s concentration.<br>
<br>
“Who goes?” he called casually, taking another sip of his wine.<br>
<br>
“Two blue Elfs say they speak to you,” answered the guttural response of an orc outside.  “You say enter or leave?”<br>
<br>
D’Vinn parted the window curtains next to him, seeing the high moon’s ascent through the sky.  It was late, he thought.  The hour approached midnight – far too late for an audience with any wayward petitioners in the area.  Still, any chance to gain some form of interaction with his own kind was always a welcome reprieve from having to deal with boorish orcs every day.<br>
<br>
“Did they say what this is about?” he called back.<br>
<br>
The orc’s voice lowered, probably addressing the very petitioners in question.  Waiting patiently for a response, he tried to make out the words, but could only hear his name mentioned a few times through the door.<br>
<br>
“Ambassador D’Vinn?” The sweet timbre of a female voice rose above the orc’s.  “My name is Dreketh from the Lodge of the Dead.  I have come to you regarding the army.”<br>
<br>
D’Vinn’s face rose at hearing the sound of a female voice.  While the ambassador often gave concessions to his own race, the occasion to entertain a female was turned down almost as rarely as the opportunity presented itself.<br>
<br>
“Enter,” he replied immediately.  Setting the wine goblet down gently on the end table, the ambassador rose from his seat to receive his latest guests from Neriak.<br>
<br>
The door opened on creaking hinges.  Outside, he caught sight of the orc in the hallway, who made a laughable attempt at refined courtesy.  Rather than graciously extending a hand, inviting the guests to enter, the orc waved his arms brutishly in the direction of the room.  Rolling his eyes, the ambassador made a mental note to have yet another lesson in civility with the ill-mannered creature.<br>
<br>
Inept pleasantries notwithstanding, an armor-clad female entered with a curt, efficient air emblematic of a shadow knight.  She was attractive and young, likely having just recently been granted knighthood in the guild.  D’Vinn smiled inwardly in delight as well as outwardly in cordial greeting.<br>
<br>
“Welcome, shadow knight,” he said with his usual geniality, extending his hand.  Yanking off her right gauntlet, Dreketh accepted his gesture in her own firm grip.  “Thank you for meeting with us, ambassador.  I know it’s late, but I come to discuss a matter of grave importance.”<br>
<br>
Direct and to the point, D’Vinn thought to himself, looking into the shadow knight’s eyes.  Indeed, this young woman portrayed every characteristic of her title.  “I would not refuse one such as you, my dear,” he said with a slight bow.  “Contact with one of the blood is a pleasantry I rarely enjoy out here in the sticks.  Please enter and make yourself comfortable.  Your associate as well…?”  D’Vinn looked briefly over Dreketh’s shoulder.<br>
<br>
Turning, Dreketh was met with an empty hallway.  “Laera?” she called.  “Laera, enter at once.  You’re embarrassing me in front of the ambassador!”<br>
<br>
From around the corner poked the head of a small Dark Elf – also female, much to Ambassador D’Vinn’s delight.  Similarly trim and well proportioned, this one seemed unusually timid.  Curiously, the ambassador could not quite determine to what guild she might have belonged.  The nondescript, cloth chemise she wore gave no such indication.<br>
<br>
“Ambassador, may I present my squire, Laera,” Dreketh said, her hand extended toward the disguised Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
Laera’s eyes passed over the ambassador’s seasoned face, barely making eye contact before looking away.  D’Vinn was forced to lower his head to get a clear look at the young lady’s face.<br>
<br>
“Rather sheepish for a shadow knight in the making, isn’t she?” he asked inquiringly.<br>
<br>
“You’ll have to forgive my servant, ambassador,” Dreketh apologized.  “Only three months ago, she was abducted by a roving band of Human raiders in the Commonlands.  The males were apparently… starved for pleasure, shall we say?”  The ambassador nodded in grim understanding.  “She has since come of guilder age, and I have taken her under my tutelage, but things are progressing slowly as I’m sure you can imagine.”<br>
<br>
“I can,” the ambassador said evenly, his eyes on the apprehensive girl.  Reaching out, he took her hand in his own and, noting her flinch, raised it to his lips.  “Fear not, child.  You are among allies here.  One day you will taste the blood of your foes in sweet revenge as a knight of the Father, I have no doubt.”<br>
<br>
Laera cast her companion an anxious look, silently begging Dreketh to steer matters away from her.<br>
<br>
“Ambassador, about the issue at hand…” Dreketh broke in.<br>
<br>
Silently, D’Vinn continued to stare at the druid, seemingly oblivious to the shadow knight’s words.  Laera’s angst grew visibly under the ambassador’s continued scrutiny.<br>
<br>
Dreketh cleared her throat.   “Ambassador?”<br>
<br>
“Yes!” D’Vinn answered almost immediately, his gaze never moving from Laera.  “Where are my manners?  I fear living among the uncouth for so long has dulled my courtesies.  Enter and be seated.”<br>
<br>
At length, the ambassador broke his gaze with the disguised Wood Elf to close the door behind her.  Turning, D’Vinn approached a nearby cabinet to retrieve another wineglass while Dreketh stole a few private words with her companion.<br>
<br>
“This ambassador is no fool.  Start behaving like a Dark Elf,” the shadow knight whispered urgently, leading her companion beside a crude divan.  When she spoke again, it was in a normal tone.  “Stand here, Laera, and assume the stance.”<br>
<br>
Confused, Laera turned a questioning eye to her companion.  Dreketh stood, feet apart and arms clasped behind her back.  The shadow knight raised an eyebrow and nodded, silently telling the Wood Elf to imitate her.  As dutifully as she could, Laera did as she was told.<br>
<br>
“Excellent,” Dreketh said sharply.  “Stay that way until it is time to leave.”<br>
<br>
“Y-yes sir,” Laera stammered, unaccustomed to military etiquette – particularly that of the Teir’Dal.<br>
<br>
“Yes mistress,” the shadow knight corrected sternly.  She held up two fingers before the Wood Elf’s face.  “That is now two points in the last hour, initiate.  One more and you sleep standing tonight, clear?”<br>
<br>
“Yes… mistress,” the Wood Elf said slowly.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh yanked off her other gauntlet and pressed them both against the druid’s midriff.  Recognizing her cue, Laera took them in hand without a word.<br>
<br>
Looking around casually, Dreketh stepped before the divan, politely waiting to sit before her host rested in his own chair.  Turning, she found the ambassador standing before her, a crystal goblet filled with wine in his hand.<br>
<br>
“I see your initiate is in capable hands,” he complimented, holding the glass toward her.  “Judging by your youth, I imagine the lessons learned of a young knight are still fresh in your own mind.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh accepted the wine with a small nod.  “They are,” she replied.  “Master Tolax is an accomplished teacher.”<br>
<br>
“Of course.”  The ambassador sat, gesturing for Dreketh to do the same.  “He is a credit to the Denizens of the Dead and the Teir’Dal, as are his learned students.”  D’Vinn raised his glass, saluting the shadow knight across from him.<br>
<br>
Raising her own glass, Dreketh accepted the compliment, wetting her lips with the wine.  <br>
<br>
“Now then,” the ambassador said, taking on a businesslike tone.  “What can the Teir’Dal embassy in Crushbone do for you?”<br>
<br>
“Ambassador,” Dreketh answered, her tone tone suddenly serious.  “I… trust you are aware of the army of Tunare massing in Lesser Faydark…”<br>
<br>
D’Vinn swallowed a mouthful of his drink, nodding slowly.<br>
<br>
“I came across it while on my way to hunt in Steamfont,” Dreketh explained.  “The sheer numbers of Elves and Humans disturb me.”<br>
<br>
“You are not alone,” the ambassador replied grimly.<br>
<br>
“Do you know where the army marches?” the shadow knight pressed forward carefully.  “Is Neriak in danger?  Or perhaps you here Crushbone?”<br>
<br>
“Humans have no interest in helping Elves defeat Clan Crushbone,” Ambassador D’Vinn replied with a dismissive gesture.  “And as far as our home goes, it is always in danger.”<br>
<br>
“What is Neriak’s stance on this?” the shadow knight asked, taking another sip.  “Are we to meet this force with our own dragoons before it has a chance to reach Nektulos?”<br>
<br>
“Why do you ask?”  D’vinn’s eyes studied the young woman closely.<br>
<br>
“I wish to know if we are massing our forces,” Dreketh replied evenly.  “If we are prepared to meet this threat, I wish to join my comrades and fight at their side.”<br>
<br>
The ambassador’s eyes shifted smoothly to look up at Laera standing several feet from the shadow knight.  D’Vinn’s jaw muscled clenched.  Laera did her best to look dutiful, keeping her eyes steady and away from the ambassador’s gaze.<br>
<br>
“What do you take me for, a fool?” the ambassador said softly, looking back down at Dreketh.<br>
<br>
The young shadow knight tried not to blanch.  “Ambassador?”<br>
<br>
D’Vinn casually gestured at Laera with his half-full goblet.  “She is no more a shadow knight initiate than I am an orc,” he said, his voice grim.  “And you are no more interested in joining your comrades than she is your servant.”<br>
<br>
A bead of sweat formed on Dreketh’s temple.  Knowing it wasn’t worth denying in the face of the ambassador’s practiced and discerning eyes, she took a longer pull at the wine.<br>
<br>
“Your questions,” D’Vinn continued, standing to pace toward his two guests, “ring with the sound of treason as clearly as a Gnomish whistle rings with the sound of steam.  Treasonous, that is, for you,” he pointed to Dreketh, still sitting in her place on the divan.  He turned a critical eye toward Laera, approaching her closely.  “But not for you.  Is it… Wood Elf?”<br>
<br>
Stunned at being unmasked by this obviously strong and powerful Teir’Dal, Laera looked nervously from one of the ambassador’s eyes to the other.  As her panic rose, so did the muscles in her neck, further accentuating them.<br>
<br>
“I must admit,” the ambassador said, turning his back on the druid, “the disguise is exceptional.  Were it not for her manner, I would never have thought to look closely enough to call her bluff.  The orcs are easily fooled, but I found her ineptitude – even as an initiate and victim of mass rape – to be unconvincing for a Teir’Dal female.  By nature, she should be focused on revenge as a starving wolf is focused on his next meal.”<br>
<br>
Sighing audibly her exasperation with Laera’s performance, Dreketh took another drink from her glass.<br>
<br>
“You are not guiltless either, my dear,” D’Vinn addressed her as well, taking measured steps toward the divan.  “Any shadow knight not in exile from Neriak would know fully well if an army were massing.  Your dancing around the issue speaks volumes to me that you are, in fact, an outcast from your brethren and quite possibly a turncoat…” The ambassador leaned down to whisper to her face.  “An Elf lover.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh closed her eyes at hearing that phrase.  “What are you going to do?” she whispered.<br>
<br>
D’Vinn stood upright again to continue, his index finger raised.  “One word from me and a detachment of orc legionnaires will storm through that door.  At my very whim, they will tear both of you apart with nothing more than their bare hands right here in this room.  They will even clean the mess after they are finished without my even asking.”<br>
<br>
Laera turned an alarmed look to her companion, finding Dreketh meeting the ambassador’s words with calm equanimity.<br>
<br>
“I entertained the thought of doing just that,” the ambassador continued, taking another sip from his goblet.  “But something troubled me all the same.  Why would a Dark Elf attempt to smuggle an obviously docile Wood Elf past a multitude of orcs to meet with me?  Surely not to spy.  Even the High Council of Felwithe knows I am kept as much in the dark as possible about goings on in Neriak.  To do otherwise would be reckless and foolish for one residing so close to a blood enemy, much less two.<br>
<br>
“So, I ask you now, shadow knight,” D’Vinn concluded.  “Why?  Your answer will determine my response to your question.”<br>
<br>
“It seems Erudite philosophers aren’t the only ones who have cornered the market when it comes to finding truth,” Dreketh said, tossing back the last of her wine.<br>
<br>
D’Vinn’s expression didn’t waver.  “Diplomacy is the second-oldest profession,” he said grimly.  “Now… who are you, and what do you want?  The truth.”<br>
<br>
Licking her lips, Dreketh considered her options.  Obviously, the skilled ambassador could sniff out truth in much the same way most people sniffed out garlic in an empty room.  Any contrary words she might have chosen to say could very well lead to the fate he boasted.  Very well, then.  If truth was D’Vinn’s medium, he would have it.<br>
<br>
Her mind made up, Dreketh stood to address the ambassador.  “I am whom I claimed,” she said flatly.  “I am Dreketh…” She paused, swallowing.  “Surrogate daughter of Xon Quexill, and advocate of Innoruuk in the Pact of Zeranon.”<br>
<br>
D’Vinn’s eyes gave no hint of emotion, their gaze piercing straight through the shadow knight and her confession.<br>
<br>
Dreketh extended a hand toward her companion.  “This is Laera Nellynwae,” she said.  “Druid, and advocate of Tunare in the Pact.  We are here to discover how the Teir’Dal intend to deal with the threat in Lesser Faydark, to find out what is happening with my sect in Neriak, and how these relate to a priest named Kella N’Threk in the temple of Innoruuk.”<br>
<br>
The ambassador stood, waiting to see if the shadow knight had anything further to say.  His face continued to remain expressionless as he searched her for any signs of deception.<br>
<br>
“In my profession,” he said calmly, “you get used to sweet talk, half-truths, and outright lies from everyone you encounter.  So common is it that you start to expect it, and even become surprised when the rare individual comes along who is willing to lay the whole truth before you.”<br>
<br>
Setting his wineglass down, Ambassador D’vinn drew his chin up.  “You have managed to surprise me, young woman,” he said sternly.<br>
<br>
Dreketh slowly released her breath in a whispered sigh of relief.<br>
<br>
“But by the terms of the treaty with Crushbone, this room is Teir’Dal soil,” the ambassador continued, strolling toward Laera.  “It may not look like much to you or your associate, but it is the only part of home I have.  It is the only place for a thousand miles where the laws of the Father rule supreme over all other places.  It is my home, my sanctuary, and my refuge.”  He came to stop before Laera, his expression one of disapproval.  “And the presence of this one offends me.  Her company desecrates the grounds of the Father, and I will not have it.  Remove her… now.”  Casting the druid one final look of disgust, Ambassador D’Vinn turned away, striding across the room to look silently out the window.<br>
<br>
Laera watched, dumbfounded, as the ambassador walked away.  Before she could react, Dreketh was next to her, muttering softly near her ear.<br>
<br>
“You’re going to have to go,” she said grudgingly under her breath. <br>
<br>
“What about the Pact?” the druid replied in a whisper.<br>
<br>
“Listen, we’re lucky he didn’t kill you on the spot,” Dreketh replied, taking the druid by the shoulder toward the door.  “His tolerance will only go so far.  So wait outside, go for a walk, anything, just leave us alone in here for a while.”<br>
<br>
“Fine, fine.”  Laera was in no mood to argue.  Cooperating, she pulled the door open and started to leave when a thought occurred, causing her to stop and turn around.  “Dreketh…”  <br>
<br>
The shadow knight held the door, her expression one of brevity.  “What?”<br>
<br>
“Will you… be okay in there alone with him?” she asked.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s expression turned bewildered.  “What?” she repeated, exasperated.<br>
<br>
Laera glanced down the hallway, ensuring that nobody was in earshot.  “You said it was an ambassador who… took you,” she said with a slight shrug, lacking any other polite term to use.  “Are you sure you’ll be okay alone with him in there?”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight’s eyes narrowed, her mouth open.  “You’re asking if…” she faltered.  Blinking, she shook her head.  “I mean… yes, I should be okay.”<br>
<br>
The druid nodded unsurely, her eyes still questioning.<br>
<br>
Dreketh placed a comforting hand on her companion’s shoulder, her manner more confident.  “Yes, I’ll be fine,” she said with sincerity.<br>
<br>
Laera closed her mouth, nodding again.  “I’ll be out here if you need anything,” she said, thumbing over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be out in a few minutes,” the Dark Elf reassured, closing the door behind her companion.  The latch clicked into place, and Dreketh stood with her hand on the door, pondering.  She very nearly forgot the ambassador’s presence before he spoke.<br>
<br>
“So…” he said, turning from the window.  “How is it a daughter of Innoruuk comes into the company of a Wood Elf, showing up on my doorstep asking about military maneuvers in Neriak?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked up at the ambassador across the room, her gaze calm but irresolute.<br>
<br>
“How is it,” the ambassador continued, stepping away from the window, “that a Teir’Dal familiarizes herself so closely with a blood enemy, that that very enemy openly shows concern for your safety?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked away, searching for words of where to begin.  “I… I don’t…”<br>
<br>
“Is it this ‘Pact of Zeranon?’ ” D’Vinn asked abruptly.  Assessing the shadow knight’s reaction closely, his manner turned speculative.  “Or is it something else…?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh closed her mouth, making no further attempt to speak.  Approaching the shadow knight with measured, even steps, the Teir’Dal ambassador leaned forward, his eyes narrow.  <br>
<br>
“What is your story?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ambassador D’Vinn was, perhaps, the most widely known name in the annals of Dark Elf diplomatic circles – such as they were.  His exploits as negotiator of several treaties between the Teir’Dal and the Troll city of Grobb on the southern tip of Antonica were legendary, even in textbooks outside the political and diplomatic province.  D’Vinn’s proven success and appeal toward other races earned him a seat of honor among his peers – in practice, if not in title.<br>
<br>
Due to his efforts in Grobb, the city-state of Neriak enjoyed benefits that could be described as nothing less than bountiful.  Hostilities between the two races ceased – hostilities the Teir’Dal could not afford in their situation.  Trade sanctions were opened, allowing the isolated cavern city to take clear advantage of Grobb’s resources.   It was expected that D’Vinn would immediately be promoted to the title of “Lord Ambassador,” within three days of his homecoming to Neriak.  <br>
<br>
Expectantly, everyone waited for the announcement to come across the council floor, announcing the ambassador’s reward for such exemplary service.  When, in fact, an announcement of reassignment was declared, effectively banishing Ambassador D’Vinn to the remote empire of Crushbone, gasps of astonishment echoed through the chamber.  The proclamation came as a shock to everyone.<br>
<br>
Everyone, that is, but D’Vinn himself.  He knew his political rivals had long been maneuvering him into position for this assignment.  He knew well how his delegation to Grobb was merely a strategic tactic to serve this end.  It mattered little to his rivals where he was or how commendable his performance – so long as he was away from Neriak.  Close by, he remained a threat to them, where his innate skill in diplomacy threatened their positions and individual standing – even to several seats on the council.  <br>
<br>
D’Vinn’s triumphant return from Grobb presented the council members with little worry.  Their solution was simple: Claim the situation in Crushbone was of “vital importance,” capable of being solved only by D’Vinn’s singular and prodigious ability as a diplomat.  The political standing with the orcs was in urgent need of rectification, and it was imperative that the ambassador leave Neriak at once to take up his new position on Faydwer.  <br>
<br>
So be it, as far as D’Vinn was concerned.  He knew well enough how it was a fool’s mission they sent him on.  Nevertheless, the ambassador graciously accepted the assignment, and left Neriak the following eve.<br>
<br>
Minor celebrity though he may have been among the Teir’Dal, D’Vinn’s name and reputation served to become more popular than the man – a circumstance that also suited him fine.  One way or another, he determined to make the best of his position at Crushbone.  Even if a political alliance was not in the cards, there was more than one way to take advantage of the situation on Faydwer, and D’Vinn was determined to find it.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s understanding of the ambassador’s history was sketchy at best, as political maneuverings served only to distract most of the practitioners of necromancy from their studies.  The guild masters and higher ranking Denizens of the Dead tended to run interference in political matters, so their understudies could focus on more important matters – lessons, quests, research and so forth.<br>
<br>
Even so, D’Vinn’s name still preceded him, and the ambassador’s willingness to accept the truth for what it was duly impressed Dreketh.  Minutes passed as she recounted the story that had unfolded over the past several months, along with everything she knew about the Pact of Zeranon.  Patiently, D’Vinn sat and listened to the shadow knight weave her tale, interrupting only to offer her more wine or a morsel to eat.  <br>
<br>
Upon Dreketh’s conclusion, the ambassador nodded silently.  Seeing the shadow knight’s curious look, he took one final sip of his drink and set the goblet on the end table next to the empty bottle.<br>
<br>
“What you say, knight, rings true,” he said leaning forward in his seat.  “In my position, I am often limited by the fact that Neriak tells me only what they can afford to have compromised in case disaster strikes and Crushbone is overrun.  What you say now explains the massing of armies and the sudden posturing that is taking place.<br>
<br>
“I have been told not to give over to concern regarding Tunare’s army,” the ambassador continued, his tone turning ironic.  “The council believes that it will indeed march onto Neriak and leave Crushbone untouched.  At the very most, we may encounter a small, perfunctory force to keep the orcs occupied, in case they get it into their heads to raid Kelethin in the army’s absence.  That is all I’ve been told.”  D’Vinn turned his attention toward Dreketh, noting her look of concern.  “It would seem our situations are not dissimilar, my dear.”<br>
<br>
“How’s that?” Dreketh asked wearily.<br>
<br>
“We both worry about our homeland, but remain unable to do anything about it,” he replied, taking time to ponder his own words.  “Or perhaps I’m the only one unable to act.  It could very well be that you as a would-be traitor have more power to affect the outcome than any other person alive.”<br>
<br>
“What can I do about an army?” Dreketh shrugged, her hands wide.  “If what you say is true, Tunare’s followers will soon be invading the gates of Neriak, and I’ll still be chasing after this infernal prophecy.”<br>
<br>
“Think about it a moment,” D’Vinn counseled the distraught shadow knight.  “If this Cup of Ages you refer to really contains the power of the gods, and you take possession of it in the name of Innoruuk, no force could oppose the Teir’Dal in this world.  The children of Hate would immediately conquer all lands of Norrath, and I would very quickly be out of a job.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked up to see the ambassador’s wry smile.<br>
<br>
“Are you saying that the war is supposed to give me incentive to find the Chalice?” she asked quietly.<br>
<br>
“That is one of many possibilities,” the ambassador replied.  “It may be possible that things are more straightforward.  Perhaps war is being waged for simple possession of the Chalice – no more, no less.”<br>
<br>
“You don’t sound too sure of that,” Dreketh observed.<br>
<br>
D’Vinn shook his head slowly.  “In my experience, things are never that simple,” he said.  “But past all this speculation is the here and now.  Speaking in the here and now, I ask you again… Why have you come to me?”<br>
<br>
“Because I have a choice to make in this Pact,” Dreketh replied.  “I need to know all I can about what is happening in Neriak so I can make sure my decision is an informed one.”<br>
<br>
“Admirable,” D’Vinn commented.  “An informed decision is always preferable over any guess whenever possible, but now that you know there is an army of Teir’Dal, Ogres, and Trolls massing to Neriak’s defense, how does that help you?  How does it affect your decisions?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh opened her mouth to speak when the D’Vinn interrupted.<br>
<br>
“Don’t tell me, I already know,” he said, holding up his hand.  “It doesn’t.  It never did, and I think you’ve known that all along.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight closed her mouth, considering the ambassador’s words.  Allowing Dreketh several moments to consider her motives, D’Vinn repeated his question.<br>
<br>
“Why are you here?” he whispered.  “Why go through this charade, even to the extent of transforming your partner into a Teir’Dal, just to confer with me?”<br>
<br>
Looking out the window, Dreketh pressed her lips together trying to retain her composure before the ambassador.  Her brow lowered, tears misting her eyes as she fought against the wave of emotions that swept over her, as she herself suddenly understood why she had gone to such great lengths.<br>
<br>
“Because-” she muttered, halting to clear her throat.  “Every day I spend with the Wood Elf, the farther it feels I’m getting from Neriak.  Not just Neriak, but from Lodge of the Dead, my father Xon Quexill, and…”<br>
<br>
“And…?” the ambassador prompted.<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s face turned a mild shade of violet, her pulse racing.  “And… the principles of Hate.”<br>
<br>
Ambassador D’Vinn sat watching the mortified shadow knight without comment, knowing that anything he could say at that moment would only discourage Dreketh from confiding in him further.<br>
<br>
“At first it was easy,” she continued, her mouth dry.  “The little wench was more annoying than a barbed dagger in the side.  But the more time I spend with her, the more difficulty I have hating her.  I still hate her race and everything it stands for,” she reassured the ambassador.  “But she as a person…”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight’s breathing became strained as she fought to speak through clenched teeth.  “And now I see her in her territory – her home, and I can’t help burn with jealousy.  No matter what I do, I can’t go home.  I’m not welcome among the ranks of my own people.  After what happened in Neriak, I’m not sure I even want to return-” Dreketh looked down to find her hands clenched into tight fists.  Startled, she released them slowly, discovering drops of blood in her palms where her fingernails had dug into the skin.  <br>
<br>
“For the first time, I feel alone,” she continued, her voice detached.  “More alone than I felt as a child when my parents were killed.  This time I have no guild master to take me in, to nurture me and care for my best interests.  The last time someone took care of me like that… it was a particular Wood Elf druid.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s jaw clenched.  “I just… a part of me needs to know if Neriak – the Neriak I knew – is even still there.  And if it is, is it worth returning to?”<br>
<br>
D’Vinn watched as Dreketh’s features twisted into an embittered scowl.  She fumed, hating the tears in her own eyes that started running down her blue cheeks.  It was plain to see that the shadow knight hated herself as well, for sake of her own feelings – feelings she could not control or banish.<br>
<br>
The ambassador spoke calmly in the muted silence.  “This Wood Elf you have been traveling with… this ‘Laera Nellynwae.’  Do you love her?”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight closed her eyes, trembling.  The room suddenly felt very hot and uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
“Do you love her?” D’Vinn repeated.<br>
<br>
With the smallest of whispers, Dreketh answered the ambassador’s question with a single word.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The ages of Norrath passed endlessly as Laera stood in the hallway outside the ambassador’s chamber.  The occasional patrolling centurion wandered past every five minutes or so, unnerving the wary druid.  She had to constantly remind herself that, for all intents and purposes, she was no longer a Wood Elf standing alone among a mass of bloodthirsty orcs.  What they saw was a Teir’Dal standing outside her own ambassador’s quarters and nothing more.<br>
<br>
In time, Laera grew accustomed to the sight of orcs, and managed to suppress her natural instinct to panic whenever they passed close by.  Instead, she studiously ignored them.  Such characteristic behavior seemed appropriate for a Dark Elf, and it kept her from running from this place in sheer terror, so she figured the strategy was sound.<br>
<br>
Groaning inwardly, Laera shook her head, berating herself for not making that determination ten minutes earlier.  Thinking back on her performance inside the ambassador’s room, the druid slumped with her back against the cold stone wall.  A child would never have been fooled by that masquerade, much less a discerning Teir’Dal ambassador.  She had a better chance of deceiving him with her dragon impression – at least then there was a chance she’d get his sympathy vote on grounds of insanity, instead of simply being labeled as the naïve little Wood Elf she was.<br>
<br>
If there had been a rock nearby, Laera would have kicked it.  Instead, she paced back and forth in the hallway outside the ambassador’s quarters.  She didn’t know what she expected once Dreketh closed the door, but silence wasn’t it.  Ambassador D’Vinn did not look pleased about her presence in any way, shape or form, and she wouldn’t have been surprised to hear him blow up at Dreketh for smuggling her onto Teir’Dal soil.  She half-expected the door to swing open suddenly with the shadow knight scurrying to get out and take them both as far away from Crushbone as possible.  Why that image came so clearly to mind, Laera couldn’t say, but it was so lucid, she actually became surprised when it didn’t happen.<br>
<br>
Step, step, step.  The druid’s slow, measured footfalls echoed through the windowless passage.  Laera began to feel cramped in the stifling cave tunnel the orcs called a hallway.  Irritably, she decided that living underground was best left to Dark Elves and Dwarves – not Wood Elves.  The minutes continued to pass, and Laera told herself repeatedly that at least she wasn’t surrounded on all sides by thousands of tons of mountain.  Knowing this helped her claustrophobic tendencies, but she knew it wouldn’t forever.<br>
<br>
Step, step, step.  What could they possibly be talking about inside that room?  It was a minimal question: Is there an army massing in Neriak, or isn’t there?  A simple yes or no ended that conversation, for crying out loud.  Laera resented being left on her own for so long, stuck in a stuffy underground mineshaft with no sun, moon or even some gnomish gadget to judge how much time had passed.<br>
<br>
Step, step, step.  This is ridiculous, she thought at last.  Dreketh said she was going to be fine in there.  Good enough.  At seeing the sixth patrolling centurion walk past, Laera decided it was time to take the Dark Elf’s advice and go for a walk in the open air.<br>
<br>
Laera had never before seen the inside of Clan Crushbone.  Acolytes were forbidden to even enter the orcish camp outside the vale, saying it was far too dangerous to risk the future of Kelethin on the chance that the orcs would choose that moment to mass an invasion.  <br>
<br>
That was fine – no love was lost.  What few orcs Laera had encountered in the forest were crude, smelly, and primitive.  If their kind disappeared off the face of Norrath, she wouldn’t have lost a moment’s sleep.<br>
<br>
Stepping out through the archway into the vale of Clan Crushbone, Laera decided she was no longer sure of that sentiment.  Like Neriak, the community took the Wood Elf by surprise.  It was one thing to see orcs armed to the teeth, running toward you with a lust for blood.  It was entirely another to see them among each other in their normal, day-to-day lifestyle.<br>
<br>
Where Laera expected to see orcs roving about, swiping at each other like savages, she saw them going about their business like most any other culture of Norrath.  Where she expected to find anarchy and barbarism, she found orcs gathered around communal fires, cooking their meals in small groups.  Where she imagined would be crude tents and squalor were actual buildings where the orcs lived and congregated.  <br>
<br>
Above it all, however, could be heard the constant crack of a whip off in the distance.  The slave pits, Laera realized.<br>
<br>
Any sense of complacency Laera might have felt over what she saw was quelled as she listened to the frightful sound coming from the castle grounds.  She knew that every crack of that whip meant a painful blow was being dealt to some poor Wood Elf slave with a pickaxe.  Possibly it was a High Elf, or perhaps even a Dwarf.  Orcs tended to be indiscriminate over who they enslaved for manual labors.<br>
<br>
Laera felt her shame grow.  It didn’t matter that she couldn’t do anything about it.  All that mattered was that there were people no more than fifty paces away who were forced to live every day in agony and hopelessness, and there she stood without so much as a blemish.<br>
<br>
Closing her eyes didn’t help.  It only accentuated the harsh thrashings of the whip even more.  Visions of some unknown and forgotten Wood Elf falling under the wrath of the blood-encrusted weapon swept unbidden through her mind, causing the druid to wince visibly whenever the thunderous crack filled her ears.<br>
<br>
Laera entertained thoughts of freeing some of the slaves while she had the chance.  If she freed only one of Tunare’s children, it would be well worth the risk.  If only she could find one of the slavers alone in some isolated place…<br>
<br>
“You being Mistress Dreketh?” a gruff voice spoke.<br>
<br>
Opening her eyes, Laera glanced around.  Seeing nobody at first, she looked down to find a squat orc standing before her.  It seemed young – probably an adolescent – as it peered up at her questioningly.<br>
<br>
“Uh… no,” she replied.  “Drek-… Mistress Dreketh is inside with the ambassador.  Can I help you…?”<br>
<br>
The orc’s brow lowered.  Disappointed, it grunted.  “Mmmm.  I am runner for Neriak.  Message for Mistress Dreketh,” the orc stumbled over the Dark Elf name, his slurred accent heavy.<br>
<br>
“A message?” Laera asked.  Her interest piqued, she held out her hand.  “From whom?  Can I see it?”<br>
<br>
The orc shook his head vehemently.  “No, no!  Told only give to Mistress Dreketh.  Very ‘portant they told me.  No.”<br>
<br>
“Okay, okay, I understand,” the druid reassured quickly.  “She shouldn’t be much longer.  At least I hope not,” she muttered, rolling her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Blue Elf make good jumjum, eh?”  The orc leered.<br>
<br>
Scowling, Laera looked down at the uncouth creature with disdain.  She didn’t know what “jumjum” was, but she was fairly sure she didn’t want to know.<br>
<br>
“So, are you just waiting around for her, then?” she asked, changing the subject.<br>
<br>
“Mmmm,” the orc shrugged, its throat rumbling deeply.  “No others to deliver right now, so hab no choice.  You wait here, too?  No jumjum for you, blue Elf?”<br>
<br>
“Uh, no… no jumjum.”  Laera looked uncomfortably off in the distance.<br>
<br>
“Oh,” commented the orc, apparently sympathetic to the druid’s plight.  “Well, we stuck den, eh?  We mebbe play Dromjen, you and me?”<br>
<br>
Thinking it was making another crude reference, Laera cast the orc a sharp look, a rebuke poised on her lips.  Instead of a leer, however, the Wood Elf was met with an open hand held up toward her.  Two small, white objects rested in its palm.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me…?” she said.<br>
<br>
“Dromjen,” the orc insisted.  “You nebber play Dromjen?”<br>
<br>
“No,” Laera replied.  “We don’t have that game in-… where I’m from.”<br>
<br>
The orc’s eyes lit up like candles during the Winter Solstice.  “Oooooh!  You miss good game, blue Elf!  Challenge!  Fun!  I show you now?”<br>
<br>
“Uh…” Laera looked around, trying to find some means of escape.  Sighing, she found none.  “Okay, maybe for a few minutes.”<br>
<br>
A smile broadened the orc’s face.  “Good, we play.  Me Guurg,” the orc introduced himself, his oversized hand extended.<br>
<br>
“Laera.”  The druid winced, her own hand lost in the orc’s firm grip.  Had it not been for the gloves she wore, the handshake might have actually been painful.<br>
<br>
“Laywra,” Guurg said, trying out the unfamiliar Elf word.<br>
<br>
“Close enough,” Laera assured the orc.<br>
<br>
The game of Dromjen, she discovered, was mind-bogglingly simple.  It consisted of two pieces of bone – Laera presumed that’s what they were made of, at least – fashioned into four-sided pyramids used in the same manner as typical dice.  Each face held an inscription – a dagger, a sword, a club, and a skull.  Both players took one die and rolled it to see who defeated the other in that round, as determined by which face the die rested on.  The rules were as follows: Due to sheer size, the club always crushed the dagger.  Because of its sharp edge, the sword always sliced through the club.  And the quick dagger always penetrated a sword’s parry.<br>
<br>
It seemed to be cyclic reasoning to Laera, but she played along.  When asked what the skull was for, Guurg grinned and said that it meant automatic victory for that round.  <br>
<br>
Its simplicity notwithstanding, the druid caught herself actually starting to have fun with the game.  It reminded her that it was the pointless, minimal things in life that often brought the most joy.  Before long, the would-be Dark Elf was laughing out loud with her newfound orc runner friend and skilled Dromjen instructor.<br>
<br>
Through the course of their match, Guurg told Laera how orc oracles used the dice to tell the future, and how their make had been passed down from many generations of Crushbone orcs.  The druid’s limbs turned numb, her eyes wide when she heard the orc offhandedly mention that the dice made from the bones of fallen enemies on the battlefield were the most highly valued.  <br>
<br>
Looking down to the die resting in her gloved palm, Laera did her best to act nonchalant as she asked if any were made from Wood Elf bones.  Tremors shot through her stomach when Guurg nodded proudly.  She very nearly dropped the small pyramid altogether, but checked herself as the orc explained the source of those particular dice.  <br>
<br>
Their origin took her by surprise.<br>
<br>
“Your… great-grandfather?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“Mmmm,” Guurg confirmed, nodding.  “Good hunter, him.  I not ‘member him, but fodder say to keep safe.  Been in fam’ly hand long time.  Many seasons.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked at the die she held more closely.  For some odd reason, the idea of holding it no longer seemed abhorrent to her – quite the contrary.  “I’m… honored, Guurg,” she said softly.<br>
<br>
The orc’s smile broadened, pleased that the blue Elf was happy.  “You not like udder blue Elfs,” he commented, shaking his own die and tossing it to the ground before him – a sword.  “Dey not speaking good to me us’ally.  I am tinking is ‘cuz am short.”<br>
<br>
Laera tossed her own die – a dagger.  “Yeah, the orcs here don’t seem to care much for Dark Elves, either.”<br>
<br>
“You win dat one,” Guurg said offhandedly, gesturing for Laera to make another mark in the ground.  The Elf’s prowess at the game was most impressive.  “Donno why not like.  We hab same color, see?” Guurg held his arm up, showing off his own shade of blue skin.  “Why not orc and blue Elfs be friends?  It not make sense to me.”<br>
<br>
Laera felt like making a similar comment about Wood Elves, but decided it would probably be best to keep her mouth shut as she rolled her die another time.  Guurg rolled his as well, its face matching hers.<br>
<br>
“Mmmmm,” he commented with a grin.  “Both skulls!  Dat interesting.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked over the dice curiously.  “So we roll again?” she asked, reaching for her die.<br>
<br>
“No!” Guurg held his hand up, blocking the druid’s reach.  “Now we tally wins.  See who make declare.”<br>
<br>
Glancing down at the ground next to her, Laera counted her wins.  Guurg counted each mark he had made individually, stopping once to start over after losing track of the number he was on.<br>
<br>
“Twenty-nine,” the orc said with pride.<br>
<br>
“Thirty-seven,” Laera replied with a smile.<br>
<br>
Guurg was crestfallen.  “Awww,” he growled amiably.  “You start well, Laera Elf.  But make fine good player of Dromjen.”<br>
<br>
“So, I declare victory!”  Laera folded her arms in a very domineering way she imagined was most convincingly Dark-Elvish.<br>
<br>
“No, you not win yet!” the orc scolded his student.  “You declare pitcher.”<br>
<br>
“Picture?”<br>
<br>
“Yah, you say what pitcher you tink I roll next.  Den I roll and see if you winner.  If you no guess right, we start over.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf sighed.  Open-ended games were never her preference in the first place, but one created by such tenacious creatures as orcs promised to stretch her patience to new lengths.<br>
<br>
“Very well,” she said wearily.  “I think you’ll roll a sword.”<br>
<br>
“She withdraws!” Dreketh barked.  Seizing Laera by the shoulder, the shadow knight pulled her to her feet.  “What in the name of the gods do you think you’re doing?”<br>
<br>
“Ach!” Guurg groaned, his head falling into his hand.  “I roll da sword.  You beginner lucky, Laera Elf!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh glanced sharply at the downcast orc on the ground.  “What have you done?” she said, looking back to her companion, her eyes angry.<br>
<br>
“I got bored,” Laera retorted.  “You didn’t say you’d take forever in there…”<br>
<br>
“Good jumjum?” Guurg asked hopefully.<br>
<br>
“Go away!” Dreketh shouted at the orc.  Her attention returned to the druid.  “Do you have any idea what the stakes of that game are?”<br>
<br>
“Stakes?” Laera asked confusedly.<br>
<br>
“Yes, stakes!” shouted the aggravated Dark Elf. “Orcs never play anything unless there’s something to gain.  What is it?”<br>
<br>
“We… never discussed stakes,” the Wood Elf replied, uncertain.<br>
<br>
“Dromjen stakes,” Guurg stated.<br>
<br>
Dreketh groaned, covering her eyes.  Turning to squat before the orc, the shadow knight spoke with deliberate calm.  “Listen to me carefully, orc.  Your rules don’t apply to Teir’Dal.  That goes for your games as well as life in general.  Is that clear?”<br>
<br>
“One ting clear,” the orc stood his ground.  “It clear dat Laera Elf win at Dromjen and dat not change no matter how many long words you say!”  Guurg pressed his lips together stubbornly.  Reaching into his vest, he pulled out an ornate scroll case of Dark Elf design and planted it in Dreketh’s hand.  “You Mistress Dreketh, so dat for you,” he declared, folding his arms.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf looked as if she was just handed a dead rat.  “What is this?” she demanded.<br>
<br>
“Dat from blue Elf city,” the orc replied flatly.  “Say give to Mistress Dreketh to be found in visit to great Crushbone Empire.  I runner, so I come find you.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh stared blankly at the orc’s muddled explanation.  “From Neriak?”<br>
<br>
“What I just say?”  Gruug folded his arms impatiently.  “Mebbe blue Elf ears not as good as blue Elf eyes?  I say dat from blue Elf city, so is from blue Elf city!”<br>
<br>
Ignoring the orc’s comments, Dreketh unsealed the scroll case.  As she tilted it, a rolled up parchment fell lightly into her hand.<br>
<br>
“It’s from Neriak?” Laera asked softly.  “How could that be?  Who is it from – that priest of yours?”  She tried looking over the shadow knight’s shoulder, but gave up at finding the script written in the Teir’Dal language.<br>
<br>
“No…” Dreketh said, her eyes wide as she read the spidery words.  “No, it’s from my father.  Innoruuk’s bane almighty…” The shadow knight’s whispered curse faded as her eyes ran across the page.<br>
<br>
“What is it?  What does it say?”  The Wood Elf could scarcely contain her curiosity.<br>
<br>
“It’s…” Dreketh spoke distractedly, pausing to read further.  “N’Threk is dead,” she said, finishing.<br>
<br>
“The priest?” Laera asked.<br>
<br>
Dreketh nodded silently.  <br>
<br>
The druid bowed her head, unsure of what to say.  “I’m sorry,” she whispered.  Hearing no comment from her companion, she continued.  “What does this mean for us?  How does this affect the Pact?”<br>
<br>
“A lot,” Dreketh replied sullenly.  “It affects it a lot.  A new custodian has been chosen to replace Kella N’Threk, and I have been given new instructions.”<br>
<br>
Starting over, Dreketh began to read the message aloud, translating for the Wood Elf’s benefit.<br>
<br>
“Dearest…” the shadow knight paused, swallowing.  “Dearest daughter, and esteemed Advocate of Innoruuk in the Pact of Zeranon.  I send my fondest greetings and extend to you my hopes that things are progressing well with your mission…<br>
<br>
…Much has taken place in Neriak, requiring me to make contact and inform you of the events that have transpired in your absence.  To begin, I must tell you that Kella N’Threk, honored priest of Innoruuk and custodian of the Pact of Zeranon, has fallen victim to his illness and entered into the realms beyond.  May he rest in deference of the Father, beyond life and forever, amen and amen.<br>
<br>
Whatever mixed emotions we may feel at this man’s passing must be placed aside for now, I’m afraid.  Though a true and devout priest of Innoruuk, I fear the dubious actions of Kella N’Threk have proven a disservice to the Pact, its prophecy, and to the Teir’Dal race – yourself most of all.  <br>
<br>
Because of this, I have appealed to the conclave with evidence of N’Threk’s doings.  In an effort to make reparations and to undo what damage has already been made, it was decided that I should now serve as custodian of the Pact in his stead.<br>
<br>
Things progress slowly, however.  Even beyond death, Innoruuk’s priest vexes me at nearly every turn I take in discovering his designs.  Already I have thwarted a number of his itineraries, but N’Threk was no fool.  He covered his tracks with a skill that I fear rivals my own abilities to divine.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, I have finally discovered the most crucial piece of information kept hidden by the infirm priest.  I now know the location of what it is you seek, and therefore must put forth my first custodial order to you now.<br>
<br>
Dreketh, Advocate of Innoruuk, I hereby recall you to Antonica immediately.  As custodian of the Pact, I am unable to rescind a mandate of banishment set forth by a priest of Innoruuk, so I expect to meet you and your companion in neutral territory at Highpass Hold.  Any quarrel you may have with the local authority will be nullified in my company.<br>
<br>
Be wary, my daughter.  The stench of war mounts by the day, and tensions are high among our people and the Humans to the southeast.  However, I trust well your skills and prowess in evading their notice.  I would also remind you it is of grave importance that you strive to protect Tunare’s advocate from harm as well.  With each passing night, you both tread upon increasingly dangerous ground as those who seek to thwart the Pact of Zeranon conspire for your deaths.<br>
<br>
One final word.  As custodian of the Pact and as your father by proxy, I have heard tell of your progress in the untamed world.  No matter the proclamations made of our people, it is my will that you understand and never remiss the fact that you are every inch a true daughter of Innoruuk, Dreketh.  Please know that…<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s voice caught in her throat.  Her eyes narrowing, she spoke in a strangled whisper.  “Please know… that I look upon you with pride.  I always shall, come what may as warranted by the Pact and the destiny it holds for you.  Yours in life, the Father’s in death, Xon Quexill – Guild Master of Necromancy, Lodge of the Dead, Neriak.”<br>
<br>
Laera stood silently, allowing her companion several moments to retain herself before reaching out a tentative hand.  Memories of what took place on board the Golden Maiden flashed in her mind, as she recalled the last time she made this gesture.  Dreketh had brutally rebuffed the Wood Elf’s attempt to comfort her.<br>
<br>
This time, Laera’s hand made firm contact with the shadow knight’s armored shoulder, allowing the druid to consign a portion of her own strength to her companion.   This, she realized, was the proper thing for one Teir’Dal to do for another.  Where comfort was for the weak, the lending of strength was a Dark Elf’s true charity.<br>
<br>
“Your father seems a keen man…” Laera spoke quietly.  “For a Dark Elf,” she added glibly.<br>
<br>
A brief smile crossed Dreketh’s face.  “He is a keen man.  I’m proud to have been raised as his daughter.”<br>
<br>
“Not, I think, as much as he is proud to be your father,” Laera said matter-of-factly, letting her hand fall.<br>
<br>
Her face thoughtful, Dreketh glanced over the letter one more time.<br>
<br>
“In any case, it looks like our hides may have just been pulled out of the fire,” the Wood Elf commented.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps, perhaps not,” Dreketh muttered.  “Xon doesn’t mention anything specific, but I can tell he is concerned about the things Kella N’Threk has done.  One thing is certain, I’ll be happier when we’re under his protection.”<br>
<br>
Laera noted the moon’s position in the sky.  The hour was well past midnight.  “I guess you want to start heading out tonight,” she said resignedly.<br>
<br>
Dreketh rolled up the parchment, sliding it back into its case.  “I would,” she said.  “But you need rest.  We both do.”<br>
<br>
“I can make it to the edge of the Faydark tonight, if you can,” the Wood Elf said.  Though Laera made a grand show of how prepared she was to start their journey right away, the fatigue in her eyes belied her words.<br>
<br>
“We’ll catch a few hours’ sleep before dawn,” Dreketh replied.  “There’s a spot where Dark Elves typically stay the night just past the orc village.  Then we’ll head out.  Sound good?”<br>
<br>
“Sounds good,” Laera said, yawning.  She hadn’t felt it so much before, but now all the talk about sleep was making the Wood Elf realize how long it had been since she caught more than a few winks.  Nodding, she began to head toward the village when Dreketh’s voice stopped her.<br>
<br>
“Don’t forget your little friend,” she said.<br>
<br>
Unsure what the Dark Elf meant, Laera looked down to see Guurg idly tossing his Dromjen dice around on the ground near her feet.  “Oh, Guurg,” she said, getting the orc runner’s attention.  “Thank you for the game.  I enjoyed playing it with you.”<br>
<br>
“Mmmm,” the orc replied.  “You play some good Dromjen, Laera Elf.  We play again?”<br>
<br>
“Uh, no thanks.  Mistress Dreketh and I are tired and need to go get some sleep,” the druid begged.<br>
<br>
“Ahhh, gotcha.”  Guurg tossed the two dice into a pouch, pulling it closed with a quick jerk of the drawstrings.  “Laera Elf say tired, I go ahead and make ready.  Make good rest place for blue Elf.  You see!  Guurg do good job of it!”  Running with a speed rarely seen on Norrath, the orc runner sped off toward the village, leaving no time for the confused Wood Elf to say anything.<br>
<br>
Watching Guurg disappear into the distance, she turned instead to Dreketh.  “What… what was all that about?” <br>
<br>
“Congratulations,” the shadow knight replied.  Folding her arms, she started to saunter slowly after the orc.  “You’re officially the first Wood Elf ever to win a personal orc slave for a week.”<br>
<br>
<a HREF="file:///storyline/storyIL.txt">Table of Contents</a><br>
<br>
<c "#FFff00">Chapter 22 - Last Goodbyes</c><br>
<br>
A week, Laera thought to herself.  The unthinkable had happened – she was a slave owner.  She, a Wood Elf druid of Tunare, somehow owned a Crushbone orc for seven days.  Desperately, she tried to explain matters to Guurg.  Without giving away her true lineage, Laera attempted to urge, cajole and even command the orc to run off and be free, but Guurg wouldn’t hear of it.  Dromjen was Dromjen, and he insisted on upholding the stakes.<br>
<br>
Looking to Dreketh for support was of no use.  Laera had the distinct impression that the shadow knight was receiving a particularly sadistic form of amusement out of the whole thing.<br>
<br>
“Consider yourself lucky,” she explained, unrolling the straw matte on the ground.  “If you’d gone double-or-nothing, it would be two weeks.  Now get some sleep.”<br>
<br>
Grumbling in resignation, Laera began pulling off her boots.  In doing so, the further thought occurred to her – what if she had lost?  Looking to Dreketh, the druid tried to banish the thought, knowing that the Dark Elf would likely have just killed the orc outright and been on her usual way.<br>
<br>
Dismissing her doting “slave,” Laera slipped onto the matte next to Dreketh.  Though dutiful, Guurg proved to be a creature of narrow vision, procuring only one matte for his master as he had.  All the same, the orcs of Crushbone extended few amenities to their Teir’Dal visitors in the first place.  Though thin and disheveled, the woven sheet of hemp certainly beat sleeping on coarse, grimy dirt as they had been for the better part of their journey.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh lay silently, her forearm draped over her eyes to block the flickering light of the torches burning nearby.  Laera watched her companion for several moments as she settled in, an old adage about war leaping readily to the druid’s mind.<br>
<br>
“Strange bedfellows, indeed,” she whispered, watching Dreketh’s leather clad chest rise and fall in slow, even breaths.  So much had happened to them.  What was yet to come?<br>
<br>
As exhausted as she was, Laera found little rest that night.  She didn’t know if it was recent events troubling her or the fact that she was surrounded by orcs in every direction, but the Wood Elf found it difficult to do much more than doze for brief periods.  Her eyes invariably drawn to the moon glowing high above, she listened to the ominous nighttime sounds of Crushbone – whip and all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“How certain are you about this route?” Field Captain Devron asked quietly.<br>
<br>
“Positive,” Rigel answered in a whisper.  “Laera always came here when she wanted to be alone.  It’s a secret, and I’m the only other person who knows about it.  Believe me, if she intends to sneak out of Greater Faydark, this is the route she’ll take.”<br>
<br>
“Very well,” the captain nodded.  “We’ll give it until dawn.  If she hasn’t turned up by then, I’m assuming she took another route and pulling the unit back.”  Rigel opened his mouth to argue when Devron brought him up short.  “We only have eight hours before our next scouting shift begins as it is.  That’s barely enough time for us to find sufficient rest and sustenance if we live off the land during patrol.  I can’t spend any more time with this.  I’m sorry.”<br>
<br>
Biting his lip, the young druid acolyte peered from out of the brush toward the hidden path.  “I’ll stay alone, then,” he muttered.  “I’m not going to let that blue-skinned wench take-“<br>
<br>
“That’s out of the question, footman, and you know it,” Devron interceded.  “You and Druid Nellynwae are close, I know that.  But if the Teir’Dal traveling with your friend really has coerced her, I fear you would pay too high a price for your loyalty.  Only a noble spirit would go to such lengths for a friend.  I commend you for that, but I’m not willing to let you take that risk.  You’re leaving with the rest of the unit in fifteen minutes, and that’s an order.”<br>
<br>
Clenching his jaw, Rigel let out a long, slow sigh, making no further comment as the captain left to check on the rest of the unit hidden among the trees.  <br>
<br>
He still couldn’t believe what he had seen last night.  Laera – his Laera – collaborating with the blood enemy of all Elvenkind.  Casting his mind back, he could still hear her voice that fateful night months ago when she left Kelethin.  “You see, something is going on,” she had said to him.  “Something very big… I suspect it has something to do with the Teir’Dal.”<br>
<br>
Apparently her suspicions were all too correct.  It seemed that the treachery of the Dark Elves was even more dangerous than she suspected.  Now it was obvious she had fallen victim to their subversions – for the person he saw near the lift was not the Laera Nellynwae he knew.  The Laera Nellynwae he knew would never collaborate with the Teir’Dal -- never!  In her innocence, the foul beasts had obviously duped her.  <br>
<br>
There was no other explanation, and Rigel was determined to bring her back to the light.  One way or another, he would see to it that Laera was liberated from the clutches of that creature she traveled with.  Even if it meant abandoning his unit, he would do whatever it took to break his friend of her brainwashing.  Once again, she would be herself.  Once again, he would have his friend back, and this time he wasn’t letting her go again.<br>
<br>
His suspicions were confirmed at seeing Laera and the Dark Elf emerge from the trees in the company of a small Crushbone orc – probably a pawn, or even a runner.  The sight of his friend still made up all in blue to look like one of the Teir’Dal made Rigel want to leap out and snatch her away that instant, but reason prevailed over impulse.  Turning, the acolyte cupped his hand around his lips as he made a bird call, alerting the others.<br>
<br>
Laera halted dead in her tracks about fifteen yards away, causing the orc and Dark Elf to pass her by several paces before realizing she had stopped.  He could hear the inkie’s loathsome voice sound shrill among the trees, probably demanding to know why her new Wood Elf plaything was holding everyone up.<br>
<br>
Before long, Captain Devron was at his side again.  “That’s them?” he whispered.<br>
<br>
Rigel nodded once, pointing toward Laera.  “Left side, all in leather,” he muttered.<br>
<br>
“Very well,” the captain said, making several hand signals to the trees behind.  “She’s your friend.  Do you think you can handle her when we make our move?”<br>
<br>
“She won’t hurt me.  She saved my life near the lift yesterday,” Rigel replied with confidence.<br>
<br>
“Fine, you take the left flank and subdue your friend.  We’ll take care of the blue skins.”<br>
<br>
Nodding, Rigel rose to a crouch, moving into position.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“What’s wrong now?” Dreketh asked the trailing druid.<br>
<br>
“That bird,” Laera answered, her eyes darting among the greenery.  “It sounded like a meadowlark.”<br>
<br>
“So?” the shadow knight shrugged, impatient to keep moving.<br>
<br>
“So when have you ever known meadowlarks to flock in Greater Faydark?”<br>
<br>
“How should I know?”  Dreketh made a perfunctory glance around, seeing nothing.  <br>
<br>
“There are meadowlarks all over the valleys of Butcherblock,” the Wood Elf commented, continuing her search.  “But they never come to the deep forest.  It’s too dark and misty.”<br>
<br>
“Maybe it’s lost or something.”  Dreketh turned to continue down the secluded path.  “Come on, we need to make it to the ridge before noon.”<br>
<br>
“You don’t understand, I think that-”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s words were cut off by the quick and subtle sound of movement in the brush.  Cursing under her breath, Dreketh reacted quickly.  In a blink, her sword was drawn from its scabbard, and the Dark Elf assumed an aggressive stance facing the undergrowth where the sound came from.  <br>
<br>
Weaponless, Guurg stepped closer to the Dark Elf, his murky eyes darting from tree to tree, sensing danger.  “Dat no bird,” he commented in a grumbling voice.<br>
<br>
“Don’t move an inch,” Laera said cautiously, her own eyes glancing about with more care.<br>
<br>
“We’ve got to get out of here,” Dreketh argued.<br>
<br>
“Take one step and it may be your last,” insisted the Wood Elf.  “Scouts use bird calls to signal trouble in the forest.  If they have any seasoned rangers with them, they could kill us without even being seen.”<br>
<br>
“Then why haven’t they just killed us already?”<br>
<br>
“Because during times of war, it-“<br>
<br>
A loud thump sounded behind the three of them, like something large hitting the ground among the foliage.<br>
<br>
“No, wait!” Laera cried, but it was too late – Dreketh had already whirled about to confront the sound.<br>
<br>
To her disappointment, the shadow knight discovered it was a boulder about the size of a child’s ball.  Rolling along the ground, it quickly disappeared into the brush.  A second curse escaped the Dark Elf’s lips as she realized it was a ruse to distract her.  She tried her best to regain her previous stance when intense pain shot up her leg, making her stumble.  Looking down, Dreketh found the steel shaft of an arrow protruding from the gap in her leggings at the back of her knee.<br>
<br>
Guurg let out an alarmed howl at the attack.  The orc runner’s voice was quickly cut short, however, as a Wood Elf female fell from the trees behind him, landing nimbly on the ground with both feet.  Giving the orc no chance to attack or escape, she plunged a gleaming dagger into his back, transforming Guurg’s howl into an agonized shriek.<br>
<br>
Dreketh grunted, sending a powerful swing of her blade toward the Wood Elf’s head.  Anticipating the attack, the agile scout blocked the sword with a main gauche that appeared in her other hand seemingly out of nowhere.  Weapons locked together, Teir’Dal and Wood Elf pressed against each other, their eyes glued to their opponent’s gaze in a test of strength and resolve.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Dreketh let go her weight on the blade, causing her enemy to overextend.  Circling her sword around, she brought it down in a swift chopping motion, causing the Wood Elf to back away in a skillful tuck and roll.  The maneuver left the dagger protruding from Guurg’s back, the orc falling to the ground as he tried in vain to grab at the handle.<br>
<br>
Her eyes on her crouching opponent before her, Dreketh twisted her blade, inverting it in her hands to deliver a powerful downward thrust that would end the Wood Elf’s life.  With another rush of wind, a second arrow struck the Dark Elf, checking the blow and allowing the crouching Wood Elf to retreat back into the trees.<br>
<br>
Releasing one hand from her sword, Dreketh clutched at her shoulder where the second arrow penetrated her tunic.  Her fingers traced quickly, but gingerly over the wound, feeling for any sign of barbs that would make pulling out the arrow a problem.  Finding none, she yanked the arrow from the wound with a jerk of her hand.<br>
<br>
More sounds came from the Dark Elf’s right hand side.  With a snarl, she brought her bloodied fingers back down to her sword.  Her muscles tense, she lashed out with the blade, keeping whatever was approaching at bay.  Two more Wood Elves challenged her, both of them male, their eyes wide and faces grim.  Dreketh immediately recognized the two as having never faced a real Teir’Dal in battle before, and sneered her contempt.<br>
<br>
Raising her sword, the shadow knight motioned with one hand, egging them on to the attack.  Cautious and wary of this Teir’Dal fighter, the two Wood Elves separated, intending to outflank the shadow knight.  Dreketh’s sneer widened into an evil grin.<br>
<br>
“If that’s the way you want it…” she muttered, leaping toward one.  <br>
<br>
Instead of striking with her sword, however, she slammed her armored shoulder into his chest as if she were smashing down a door.  Unprepared for such a maneuver, the inexperienced scout fell over backwards, hitting the ground hard as the wind left his lungs in a rush.  Wasting no time, Dreketh knelt heavily atop the weakling scout, keeping him pinned to the ground as she brought her sword immediately around to block the attack she knew was coming from behind by the other attacker.  At the same time, she wrapped her blood-encrusted bronze fingers around the throat of her defeated victim on the ground.<br>
<br>
“…So be it,” she whispered, her face twisted in a hideous display of hatred.<br>
<br>
The air cracked with divine power as the Touch was released.  The pinned Wood Elf cried out in a simpering wail, causing Dreketh’s grin to broaden.  All around, the trees echoed with the high-pitched scream of tortured pain that eventually fell to a gruesome and terrible silence.  The shadow knight watched as the spark of life left her victim’s eyes, his face frozen in a mask of agony.<br>
<br>
The pressure on her sword fell away and she turned a gleaming eye to the young whelp who dared challenge her.  The Wood Elf male backed away slowly, his face shown stunned at the sight of his friend dying in such a horrifying manner.  <br>
<br>
“Your turn,” she said, her vicious grin unwavering.  <br>
<br>
“I think not,” a calm voice spoke next to her.  <br>
<br>
Twisting about in alarm at the unexpected threat, Dreketh came nose to nose with the gleaming silver tip of an arrow, nocked and ready to be released into her skull with full force.  Along the steel shaft, a dark brown eye stared out from behind the arrow’s fletching at the opposite end.  The Dark Elf froze in place, knowing that the slightest move meant death.<br>
<br>
“Drop your sword,” the archer said.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“No, wait!”<br>
<br>
Laera knew the stone was meant to draw the shadow knight’s attention.  It was a stealth tactic commonly taught in the schools for rangers and druids to trick the unwary.  But Dreketh’s reflexes proved to be faster than the Wood Elf’s ability to warn her of the danger.  The familiar sound of an arrow soon followed the Dark Elf’s maneuver, its razor sharp tip lodging deep into her companion’s leg in the only vulnerable spot exposed by the bronze leggings.  It was the pinpoint shot of an expert bowman – that much was certain.<br>
<br>
With the arrow’s sudden appearance, there was no longer any doubt they had been discovered by the scouting parties.  With accustomed teamwork, the hidden band defending the forest infiltrated on the intruders.<br>
<br>
Laera watched as she saw a Wood Elf female dressed in leather drop from the foliage overhead and deliver a vicious blow to Guurg with a dagger from behind.  The orc cried out, unable to defend himself from the unseen attacker.  She saw Dreketh immediately swing her sword toward the orc’s assailant, only to have it blocked by a piercing weapon in the woman’s other hand.<br>
<br>
Heart pounding, Laera broke into a run to help defend her friends when the world suddenly moved out from under her.  The Wood Elf’s vision blurred in a frenzied whirl before her head met with the forest floor, stunning her.  Laera felt the firm ground press against her body, or was it the other way around?  It tilted and spun wildly in all directions.<br>
<br>
Though she consciously knew it was impossible for the ground to be behaving in such a way, her senses refused to listen to reason.  Closing her eyes, she had no choice but to wait for the confused tilting to stop before she could do anything about it.  She also knew that she was helpless until she could recover, and every second that passed was one more chance her attacker would deliver the killing blow.<br>
<br>
Firm hands crept beneath her arms, lifting her with an almost gentle nature by the shoulders.  Laera could feel the ground fall away beneath her as her attacker tried to bring her to her feet.  Suddenly, up separated itself from down, and the turmoil clouding the druid’s head cleared.  She had presence of mind, however, enough to remain limp in her captor’s hands until the right moment.<br>
<br>
As soon as her feet met the ground firmly enough to lend her enough leverage, Laera twisted about, her elbow connecting with the man’s face with a thud.  The abrupt movement made her head pound painfully, but the druid forced herself to see through the pulsating clouds threatening to obscure her vision and reached over her shoulder to draw her staff.<br>
<br>
Before her stooped her attacker, his hands covering his face where she struck him.  Deciding it was best not to give her enemy the chance to recover and attack a second time, she swung the staff low, striking his lower legs.  Pulling hard, Laera deprived the Wood Elf scout of the ground in much the same way he had done to her.  He pitched backwards into a clutch of green, fern-like brush, rolling down a small incline hidden by the plants’ sheltering leaves.<br>
<br>
Infuriated by the sheer indignation of the scout’s stealthy attack, Laera was determined not to allow him to escape.  The druid leapt into the brush, sliding deftly down the incline on bent knees until she skidded to a halt before her prone opponent at the bottom.  Thrusting downward, Laera brought her staff to press firmly against the scout’s larynx.<br>
<br>
“If you take me down, you better be damn sure I’m out!” she said through clenched teeth, applying even more pressure on the staff to drive her lesson home.<br>
<br>
“Lae,” the scout croaked, his windpipe cut off so he could barely speak.  “What have they done to you?”<br>
<br>
The druid’s eyes widened.  There was only one person who ever called her by that nickname.<br>
<br>
“Rigel?” she asked, craning her neck.  The dirt that sullied his face along with the trail of blood flowing from his nose made the young acolyte virtually unrecognizable.  “By all the gods, what are you doing here?”<br>
<br>
The young scout shoved the wooden staff aside irritably, removing it from his throat.  “I came to take you away from that blue atrocity who captured you!” he spat.<br>
<br>
Laera stared at her old friend, her expression one of mixed astonishment and profound displeasure.  “You what?” she asked angrily.  “You led them here?  Why would you do something like that!”<br>
<br>
Rigel held his throat with one hand, scooting himself along the ground to back away from the enraged druid.  Bumping against a tree, he scrambled to pull himself upright as he spoke.  “Now, I know it’s not your fault.  You didn’t realize how treacherous they could be.  It’s okay, I understand.  We all do, Lae.  Really.”<br>
<br>
“What are you talking about?” Laera asked, exasperated at the acolyte’s patronizing tone.<br>
<br>
At that moment, the horrific cries of the dying scout rang out from beyond the hill’s crest.  Laera looked up sharply, seeing morning’s light filter in from the canopy of dense fern leaves above her head.<br>
<br>
“Gods, no!” she whispered.  Without further thought, she raced back up the incline.<br>
<br>
As she arrived at the top, she found Dreketh kneeling atop one of her attackers in the distance, grimly staring down the shaft of an arrow at point blank range.  The druid’s heart leaped into her throat, knowing that there was absolutely nothing she could do to save her companion before the archer released the bowstring.<br>
<br>
Acting on impulse, Laera stretched forth her hand, speaking several arcane words of Tunare’s protection – praying with every passing moment that the archer would not release the arrow before she could finish her spell.  She breathed a sigh of relief as she saw a bright yellow glow enveloping the Dark Elf.  Dreketh’s blue skin hardened to a wood-like texture that, while it wouldn’t protect her from all harm, would likely save her life should the arrow take flight.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight gasped, closing her eyes as she felt the protecting power sweep over her body.  She felt her skin harden beneath the armor she wore, and upon her face.  Intuitively, she knew who had cast this enchantment on her.<br>
<br>
All eyes, save for Dreketh’s, turned toward the druid several feet away.<br>
<br>
“Footman, control your charge!” the archer called to Rigel, his bow still aimed menacingly at the Dark Elf before him.  Drawing his lips in, he let out a short, high-pitched whistle.  “Come out and seize these two!  My arm’s getting tired!”<br>
<br>
A handful of Wood Elves emerged from the trees, including the female who backstabbed Guurg.  Leaning down, she yanked the orc runner up by the arm, causing him to cry out painfully from his injury.  Without any visible concern for his welfare, she wrenched her dagger from the bloody wound in his back.<br>
<br>
Two more Wood Elves took Dreketh roughly by the arms, dragging her off their fallen comrade.  Glaring her silent defiance at the archer standing over her, she reluctantly let go of her sword, allowing it to fall at the man’s feet.  <br>
<br>
“Wise move, inkie,” he said, slowly releasing the tension on his bow.  “Very wise move.”<br>
<br>
“Captain Devron,” Rigel said, passing Laera to approach the archer.  “I thought all blue skins in the forest were to be killed on sight.”<br>
<br>
“If that were the case here, your friend would already be dead,” the captain countered glibly, sliding the arrow back into his quiver.<br>
<br>
“But she is not Teir’Dal!” Rigel argued.  Turning back to Laera, he pointed to a series of score marks on her arms where their struggles had worn away the pollen.  “Look!  I told you she’s one of us!”<br>
<br>
“Had she been discovered looking like that without your forewarning, footman, then she would be dead nonetheless.”  Captain Devron turned to face Dreketh, who once again rested on her knees as the two Wood Elves grasped her arms in their steel grip.  “But I find myself intrigued,” he said curiously.  Stepping slowly toward the prisoner, he reached down to retrieve her sword lying at his feet.  “What could an inkie like you be doing with a slave girl turncoat, and an orc of Crushbone?”  <br>
<br>
Raising the blade to her chin, the captain lifted the Dark Elf’s face to look at him.  Dreketh’s azure gaze met with Devron’s brown eyes, but her mouth remained firmly shut, boldly offering no explanation, nor showing any sign of fear at the sharp edge of her father’s sword.  Moments passed as the ranger captain and shadow knight captive faced off, neither giving ground in their silent battle of wills.<br>
<br>
Keeping his eyes locked on the Dark Elf, Captain Devron turned his head slightly to address the Wood Elf female.  “Shenra, run and inform the town guard to prepare for a possible attack from Crushbone.  Whether it will be now or later cannot be determined… not yet, anyway.”  His lips curled crookedly into a slight grin aimed at Dreketh.  Apparently he intended to find out one way or another.<br>
<br>
“What about this one?” the Wood Elf named Shenra asked, jerking the orc around in her grip.<br>
<br>
Devron broke his gaze with Dreketh to look over the orc’s wound at a distance.  “That one is dead anyway,” he said offhandedly.  “These creatures can barely speak, much less be of use in an interrogation.  Leave it to die.”<br>
<br>
“You can’t be serious!” Laera spoke up for the first time, stepping forward.  “You’re a disciple of Tunare!  To kill an orc in battle is one thing, but you can’t just let him bleed to death here in front of you!”<br>
<br>
The captain turned a chilling eye Laera’s way.  “Can’t I?” he asked calmly.  “In times of war, the rules of Tunare change, Druid Nellynwae.  Were it not for your friend Rigel, all three of you would by lying dead now.  And you would be the most deserving of all for risking the lives of every man, woman, and child of your own kin,” Devron thrust an accusing finger at the druid, “by bringing this Teir’Dal to Kelethin.”<br>
<br>
Laera scowled back at the captain, her nostrils flaring, but she remained silent.<br>
<br>
“Look at you,” the captain continued, gesturing with disdain at the druid’s appearance.  “You… who consort with orcs and the spawn of Innoruuk.  You had better pray that you are broken of your insanity, or by the hand of the Mother I will see you in chains for your treachery.”<br>
<br>
Captain Devron stepped toward Laera, causing her to draw back momentarily, uncertain of the man’s intentions.<br>
<br>
”You say I can’t possibly be serious?” he asked mockingly, drawing a knife from his belt.  “Let me show you just how serious I am… ‘child’ of Tunare.”<br>
<br>
The captain tossed the knife lightly before the druid’s face, catching it by the blade in his gloved hand.  Giving Laera one final sneer, Devron turned and threw the weapon with a strong arm.<br>
<br>
The blade twirled, emitting a fluttering whistle as it sped through the air to lodge itself firmly in the orc runner’s chest.  <br>
<br>
The orc’s shriek mingled with Laera’s own voice as she cried out.  Falling to his knees, Guurg clutched at the captain’s knife, a blank look of plain disbelief on his face as his eyes rose to meet Laera’s.<br>
<br>
“Laera Elf…” he gasped, blood falling in trails from his mouth.  A small gurgling cough escaped the orc’s lips as he pitched forward to lie motionless on the ground.<br>
<br>
“No!” Laera cried.  Raising her hands, she quickly cast the druid’s spell of healing in hopes that she might catch hold of the orc’s life before the moment of death took him.  Guurg didn’t stir, however, as wave after wave of blue light enveloped the corpse.<br>
<br>
“Save it, druid,” the captain said dismissively.  “Life’s power is not to be wasted on the dead.  Besides, in time you won’t care one way or the other about the welfare of orcs or Dark Elves.  Soon, you’ll return to us as a true druid of Tunare, as you were always meant to be.”<br>
<br>
Scowling, Laera raised her hand to slap the arrogant captain across that smug face of his.  Devron’s reflexes won out as he caught her arm by the wrist.  Raising his other hand, he tugged gently at the glove she wore, finger by finger, sliding it off slowly to expose the tan skin underneath.<br>
<br>
“You see?” he said softly.  “You’re more of a Wood Elf already.”  Raising her hand to his lips, he kissed it softly.<br>
<br>
Laera trembled as she looked at the true color of her skin, idly comparing it to the smudged blue that began at her wrist.  The truth of the captain’s words drove into her in much the same way his knife drove into poor Guurg.  At one time, she wouldn’t have cared about the death of an orc – or a Teir’Dal, for that matter.  But Guurg was different.  Dreketh was different, and not just because of the Pact.   Everything was different!<br>
<br>
Balling her shaking hand into a fist, Laera began to detest that color and all it stood for.  She began to hate who she was before meeting up with Dreketh.  She became ashamed of the cavalier attitude her race had toward the death of their enemies.  <br>
<br>
Looking up, Laera saw that the captain had turned his back and stepped away, addressing what remained of his unit.<br>
<br>
“Are you all right?” Rigel asked plaintively, approaching her.<br>
<br>
“If this is what it means to be an Elf, then I’d rather be Human,” she muttered darkly.  Looking Rigel squarely in the eyes, her voice rose so all could hear.  “If this is what I am meant for, then I renounce my destiny!”<br>
<br>
Captain Devron turned to see what the druid was rambling on about, only to meet the end of her staff as it cracked sharply against his face.  Flashes of light burst through his vision, as he was unable to parry or even slow the druid’s unforeseen attack.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh recognized a cue when she saw it.  Knowing the inexperienced scouts holding her prisoner would be taken aback by the druid’s sudden move, she wrenched her arms from their hands and backhanded her gauntleted fists into their midriffs, doubling them over with two simultaneous blows.  <br>
<br>
Standing in one fluid motion, the shadow knight twisted to avoid the main gauche she anticipated from the female at her left.  Reaching out, she grabbed hold of the Wood Elf’s wrist in mid-thrust.  Raising her other arm, she brought it down with all the force her hatred could muster, elbow first, effectively snapping the bones of the woman’s forearm.<br>
<br>
Seeing her enemies flee before her, Dreketh turned toward the captain and the one named Rigel.  The captain already lay in a heap on the ground, unconscious from the druid’s sudden blow.  Her companion’s young friend stood there staring down at his felled leader in disbelief.<br>
<br>
“Wh-what have you done?”  Rigel’s stunned question ended in a choked voice, finding the shadow knight’s gleaming blade pressed against his chest.<br>
<br>
“Such interesting company you keep,” Dreketh commented.  “With friends like this one, no wonder you came looking for me.  At least we Teir’Dal are devoted to each other, if nothing else.”<br>
<br>
Receiving no response from her companion, Dreketh turned to find Laera gone.  <br>
<br>
The Wood Elf had stepped over to kneel beside the forgotten orc’s body as it lay facedown on the forest floor.  Dappled sunlight filtered through the leaves and mists to dance along the orc runner’s blue skin, giving it a mocking resemblance to the life it housed not more than three minutes before.  Now the broken body lay before her, nothing more than an empty shell.<br>
<br>
No tears marred Laera’s face as she stared, mystified, at the fallen creature.  Guurg was more than just an orc.  In the short while she had known him, he started to weave his way into the druid’s heart.  Had she been given the time, Laera knew that he would likely have become a good friend, and the fact that she couldn’t now cry at his death angered her.  The fact that she wasn’t given the time to form that bond made the Wood Elf rail against the actions of her own race – actions that robbed her of something she didn’t even realize she was about to receive.<br>
<br>
Something touched her shoulder, and Laera knew it wasn’t Rigel’s hand.  No, it was the blue hand of her blood enemy lending her a portion of strength as she herself had done in Crushbone during the Dark Elf’s moment of weakness.  Again, no words were spoken.  Words would have served to despoil the shadow knight’s gesture.  As it was, Laera somehow knew that Dreketh understood her thoughts.<br>
<br>
“I don’t believe what I am seeing.”  Rigel’s voice shattered the moment.  Both Wood Elf and Dark Elf turned serious eyes toward the impertinent acolyte standing behind them.  “You’ve killed more than one orc in your life.  What was this one to you that the others weren’t?  You’re not yourself, Lae!  You’re not!  Come back with me.  Come back to the school and I’ll help y-”<br>
<br>
Pouncing with the agility of a cat, Laera leapt up to tackle the young acolyte to the ground.   Gritting her teeth visibly, Laera ran her arms up and down Rigel’s face, staining the boy with pollen in a cluttering of unsightly blue smudges across his cheeks.<br>
<br>
“There!” she yelled into his face.  “Now you’re under the exact same influence I am!  Do you feel any less a Wood Elf?  Do you feel any less a child of Tunare now that you have blue skin?  Do you!” she demanded, clutching at his leather armor.  <br>
<br>
Rigel’s jaw worked noiselessly, unable to collect his thoughts enough to answer.  <br>
<br>
“I am Laera Nellynwae,” Laera declared, drawing herself up.  “I am a druid of Tunare and Her advocate in the Pact of Zeranon.  You are Rigel Timbrose, druid acolyte and my friend!  It’s time you start acting like my friend and trust me!”<br>
<br>
Standing, Laera threw off her white wig and tossed it into the young man’s hands.  “See?  It’s just me, Rigel,” she said, placing her palms on her chest atop the tunic she wore – the tunic he made for her.  “I’m not brainwashed or under any kind of Dark Elf spell.  I have a mission to fulfill… a mission that might actually end this war…” Laera stopped, shocked at hearing her own words and realizing the truth of them.  Turning to look at her compaion, she softly finished her sentence.  “Might actually end this war before it begins.  By the gods, that’s it.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh returned the Wood Elf’s gaze, nodding gravely.<br>
<br>
“What’s it?” Rigel demanded, sitting up.  “You don’t understand, Lae… together with our Freeport allies, we finally have the upper hand!  At last, we’ll be able to put an end to Innoruuk’s creations once and for all!”  The druid acolyte sneered Dreketh’s direction as he spoke.<br>
<br>
“Rigel, it’s more complicated than that,” Laera began, turning his way again.  “You don’t know what’s really going on.  We are all in terrible danger!”<br>
<br>
“So tell me what’s going on!” asked the Wood Elf scout, his hands spread wide.<br>
<br>
“I-“ Laera hesitated.  “I can’t.”<br>
<br>
“Why not?”<br>
<br>
Sighing, Laera leaned over to roll herself off the Wood Elf scout and rest on the ground next him.  “Rigel, listen to me,” she said, trying to find the right words to say.  “In the months I’ve been gone, I’ve been spied on, followed, chased, captured and attacked by more people and creatures than I can count.  There are very powerful people on Norrath who would like nothing more right now than to see me dead.”<br>
<br>
Rigel looked at his friend skeptically, seeing her nod with a serious look.<br>
<br>
“It’s true, Rigel,” she said, her manner grave.  Peering out the corner of her eye, she glanced at the shadow knight standing over them both.  “Dreketh, too, and for the same reasons.  I know how this sounds, but I can’t put her life at risk because I owe you an explanation.  What’s worse, I can’t put my mission at risk, threatening all our lives.  You just have to trust me, Rigel, as your friend.”  Laera reached down, touching the back of Rigel’s hand with her own.<br>
<br>
For the first time, Rigel appeared to listen to the druid’s words, his blue-smudged face drawn and earnest.  “It’s not fair, Lae,” he said.  “You expect me to trust you, but you say you can’t trust me with the truth.  There’s something wrong with that.”<br>
<br>
“I know,” she replied sincerely.  “But after all this is over, I promise you I’ll have a tale worth telling.”<br>
<br>
“I hate to break up this tidy little scene,” Dreketh piped in.  “But it won’t be long before those scouts return with their big brothers to take revenge for the black eye we just gave them.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked regretfully to the Wood Elf corpse lying nearby.  “That’s right, we need to be going,” she muttered.  Looking to Rigel, she silently asked him for the favor she needed.<br>
<br>
The acolyte waved his hand dismissively.  “Go,” he said.  “I’ll tell them I was knocked unconscious, same as the captain.  When I woke up, you were gone.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” Laera whispered, wrapping her arms tightly around her friend.  “You have no idea what you’ve just done.”<br>
<br>
“It’s okay,” Rigel answered, returning the druid’s warm embrace.  “Now, go quickly.  They’ll be here any minute.  Avoid the open paths until you reach Butcherblock Ridge.  They’re guarded heavily, especially at night.”<br>
<br>
Laera nodded, still unwilling to let go of her friend.<br>
<br>
“Come on, let’s move,” the shadow knight said urgently.  Grabbing the druid by the shoulder, Dreketh brought her to her feet.<br>
<br>
Stepping over Rigel and the captain, Laera followed the Dark Elf into the trees heading westward, pausing only once to wave her goodbyes.  <br>
<br>
Still sitting on the ground, Rigel raised his own hand to wave back.  Memories of their last farewell came to mind as he watched the foliage cover the druid’s retreat.  This time, however, the heartache he once felt at seeing her leave was no longer present.  Instead, the young acolyte felt empty inside.  For he knew, watching her disappear amidst the leaves and branches, that the Laera Nellynwae had known – the Laera Nellynwae he said goodbye to so many months ago – had already left. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The sun disappeared as it dipped below the water’s edge along the horizon.  Once again, the western sky was alight with fiery reds and yellows, falling to the indigo blue of twilight far above.  The surf was calm that evening, its waves breaking tension only a few feet from shore – and even then it seemed a half-hearted effort as the water splashed lightly over the sand.<br>
<br>
Out among the shifting waters, Laera Nellynwae washed away what remained of the pollen.  Resting naked on the sandy floor of the sea, the druid watched as the sticky blue substance separated from her skin to float in small clusters on the water surface before being swept away by the tide.  True to form, the pollen remained water resistant to the bitter end, causing the Wood Elf to scrub it vigorously with her hands before it finally surrendered.<br>
<br>
Taking a deep breath, Laera threw herself backwards below the water, dousing her face last of all.  It was a baptism she performed on herself, washing away the sins of becoming Teir’Dal, and returning to her former glory as a dark-haired, tan-skinned Wood Elf.  Only when it felt as if she was free of every inch of pollen did she resurface.<br>
<br>
Raising her arms, Laera looked at her skin in its natural state.  Like all sinners, the Wood Elf’s baptism may have washed away any evidence of her actions, but the effects they had on her spirit remained.  Fascinated, she looked at her skin color in much the same way she noted the color of Dreketh’s skin their first night together.  Like the Dark Elf, her normal coloration could never be washed away, as could the pollen.  <br>
<br>
Outwardly, Laera was once again a Wood Elf.  Inwardly, she began to wonder exactly what she was.<br>
<br>
A high-pitched whistle caught her attention.  Turning around in the water, she found Dreketh signaling to her several yards away on shore.  Dinner was served.<br>
<br>
Glancing around to make certain there were no spectators lurking about, Laera stood to wade her way back to shore through the waist-deep waters.  The evening breeze along the water’s edge was chill, making her skin rise in tiny goose bumps by the hundreds.    Thankfully, she accepted the blanket Dreketh held out, wrapping it around her shivering body before walking the rest of the way to dry land.<br>
<br>
As had happened during their journey through Butcherblock Mountains that day, neither companion spoke as they ate their meager feast around the campfire.  Since leaving Greater Faydark, both young women had been lost in their own thoughts without feeling the need to voice them.  Instead, they plodded along westward, being careful to stay away from the winding roads, but always keeping them within sight.<br>
<br>
Having finished their silent meal, Dreketh put out the fire, and the two companions lay silently in the soft sand.<br>
<br>
Loathe to close her eyes, the shadow knight stared off into the darkening sky above.  She knew with a certainty that the nightmares were about to return that night.  They returned every night in one manner or another.  Tonight, however, promised to be one of the worse ones.  She didn’t know how, but she could feel it.  It was as if a wild beast were chained up behind a closed door in her mind that would open wide if she so much as blinked.<br>
<br>
Turning her head to one side, she looked over to the Wood Elf’s dark form lying in a shadowed bundle on the sand, wrapped snugly in the blanket she’d been given.<br>
<br>
Dreketh cleared her throat softly before speaking in an even softer tone.  <br>
<br>
“Remember that spell you cast on me in the forest?” she asked.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s silhouette shifted as she turned to face her companion.  “I remember,” Laera answered hesitantly, undoubtedly expecting another rebuke.<br>
<br>
“Do you-… do you think you could cast that enchantment on me one more time?” the Dark Elf asked quietly, her voice barely heard over the noise of the surf.<br>
<br>
Laera’s head rose curiously.  “Why?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh licked her lips, her eyes returning to the night sky.  “The dreams are coming,” she whispered, her words slow and hesitant.  “I feel them approach every time I close my eyes.  I know it’s foolish, but I’d feel safer… Please?”<br>
<br>
Blinking several times, Laera inched her hand out from underneath the blanket.  Again, arcane words escaped her lips, calling forth Tunare’s blessing of nature to weave itself around the Dark Elf.  Dreketh’s breathing stopped as she felt the power sweep through her – nurturing her… protecting her… shielding her from harm.<br>
<br>
As the casting subsided, the shadow knight breathed once again, her skin having taken on the hardened quality of wood.  Drawing her own blanket up under her chin, Dreketh closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Thank you, Laera,” she whispered.<br>
<br>
Staring at her companion, the Wood Elf realized how that was the first time Dreketh had ever called her by her proper name.  Not “whelp” or “weakling” or “woodie.”  Just “Laera.”  She couldn’t remember a time when the sound of her own name had made her smile as it did at that moment<br>
<br>
Pulling her arm back underneath the blanket, the Wood Elf turned over to fall asleep herself.  Strangely, her Teir’Dal companion did not cry out that night.  No feverish cries of pain or panicked grief filled the air – only the lulling sounds of the sea were heard that night as Laera Nellynwae and her friend slept fitfully until dawn.<br>
<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 23 - Death Vendetta</c><br>
<br>
Norrath continued on its steady course, hurtling relentlessly toward the future as the majority of its inhabitants remained blind to the dangers threatening them all.  To the west, the lands of Antonius Bayle and the scholars of Odus saw the posturing of Elven nations as yet another display of how ineffectual their fey notions are.  The tall barbarians to the north likely didn’t even know of the struggle about to ensue, nor would they have cared if they did.  The Gnome, Dwarf, and Halfling nations publicly abstained from taking part in either side of the conflict, stating that since lofty Elven affairs-of-state did not include political aid of their respective nations during times of need, then neither should theirs be extended in return.<br>
<br>
Quite simply, most of the world was too wrapped up in itself to see the ominous portents the forthcoming Elven war held for the world.  Fewer still knew of the Pact and the dire consequences of the unsealing of Zeranon’s Chalice.  In short, all nations of Norrath turned a blind eye.<br>
<br>
All, that is, save for the mighty stronghold of Highpass.  For centuries, the tall fortress stood as a bastion for all nations to assemble, meet and work out their contentions peacefully.  Those of any race not currently involved in actions contrary to the good of the Highpass citizenry were welcome to enter, albeit under watchful scrutiny approaching levels of paranoia in some cases.  Teir’Dal in particular were frowned upon by the predominantly Human and Half-Elf populace.  Disciples of Innoruuk were particularly reviled, hence the shadow knight’s understandably cautious nature about passing through so many months before.  Those with blue skin were often the objects of various “accidents” under such circumstances, and were constantly reminded never to let their guard down when forced to deal with light dwellers, regardless of race.<br>
<br>
Even so, Highpass was the location where Xon Quexill had summoned his protégé and her companion, and so it was to Highpass they traveled.  <br>
<br>
Though Dreketh said repeatedly over the ensuing days that all would be set right once they were under the protective care of her father, Laera found it difficult to shake the nagging emptiness she felt in the pit of her stomach whenever she envisioned their arrival at the mountain pass.  She knew that before too long they would no longer be on their own, alone together in the world.  For some intangible reason she was unable to define, Laera was reluctant to let go of these times of journeying with Dreketh.<br>
<br>
Once again she felt her life was approaching a crossroads – the exact same feeling she had felt when she was summoned to the Temple of Tunare in Felwithe.  Once again, the puzzling sensation was difficult to describe – not exactly a feeling of dread or despair, but certainly angst over the unknown that was to come.<br>
<br>
A journey that had started as a source of ceaseless torment for the Wood Elf was ending as the most incredible experience she had ever imagined.  She could not deny that she was far and away a different person – a better person in her own mind.  Dreketh, too, seemed to change for the better as well.  Although she would never dream of broaching the subject with her partner openly, Laera believed the shadow knight would have agreed nonetheless.  <br>
<br>
If only it didn’t have to end…<br>
<br>
But inevitably, the days passed by as Norrath continued on its own particular journey, heedless of the wants or needs of any one creature it kept.  Destiny fast approached as the day of their arrival drew near, and no amount of wishing or hoping would change it.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, both Dark Elf and Wood Elf made the best of their few remaining days alone together, pondering what was to come once they reached Highpass.  Dreketh insisted that her father would have a plan already laid and waiting to proceed upon their arrival.  For the better part of her life, Xon Quexill had proven himself to be adept at handling such matters, and she saw no reason to believe that the Pact would be an exception to this rule.<br>
<br>
Despite Dreketh’s repeated assurances that no harm would befall Laera at her father’s hands, the druid couldn’t hide her trepidation at what his plan might be.  Trusted mentor or not, he was still Teir’Dal – a Teir’Dal who worshipped the Prince of Hate.  On top of that, he was also a master necromancer and someone the druid did not know, whose intentions and motivations she could only vaguely guess at.  While he may have had Dreketh’s best interests at heart, that didn’t necessarily coincide with the good of Laera’s own welfare.  Try as she might, Laera remained ill at ease when it came to trusting this man with her life, her people and her advocacy in the Pact.<br>
<br>
Knowing that in order to reach Highpass Keep they would once again have to cross the Kithicor Woods didn’t help matters any.  The druid’s debilitating fear of the undead hadn’t waned during the course of her absence, and she was reminded of it every time she thought about reentering that haunted place.<br>
<br>
Oddly, Dreketh seemed nearly as tense as her companion as they neared the edge of the forest.<br>
<br>
”Are you sure you’re alright?” Laera asked cautiously, noting the shadow knight’s tension.<br>
<br>
“It’s nothing, I’m fine.” Dreketh spoke as if trying to convince herself.  “It’s still early afternoon – we have plenty of time before nightfall.  Everything should be fine.”<br>
<br>
“Imagine that,” the Wood Elf commented behind a hidden smile.  “An inkie who’s afraid of the sun going down…”<br>
<br>
“You know what I mean,” Dreketh responded with a mild shove of the druid’s shoulder.  “If we’re caught by the undead in there, we’re theirs… neat and quick.”  The shadow knight snapped her fingers.  “We might as well wrap our souls in neat little packages and give ourselves over to the undead, for all the good fighting would do us.”<br>
<br>
Laera lost her glib manner at the shadow knight’s words.  “Don’t remind me.  I’m trying not to dwell on that.”  <br>
<br>
Glancing at the sun overhead, she took on a deliberately positive attitude.  “But you’re right.  It’s early afternoon.  Dusk isn’t coming for several hours.  We’ll be through the forest and eating a real, genuine meal in a comfortable Highpass inn before we know it.  I saw one on our way through before – the Tiger’s Roar or something.  It looked quaint.  I’ll even buy.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh rolled her eyes at the druid’s “offer.”  The two companions had long ago forgone the notion of individual finances, finding it less bothersome to merge their expenses into one shared pool.  Still, she found the Wood Elf’s optimism somewhat motivating, if not comforting.<br>
<br>
Into the shady woods the Dark Elf peered, trying to gain impetus.  In her mind’s eye, Dreketh summoned the image of her father standing at the other end of the forest, waiting for her.  Once she passed this last obstacle, everything would be all right.  At last, she would be safe from the perils of the world – bigoted light dwellers, bloodthirsty gods and her own people alike.  Xon Quexill would protect her.  <br>
<br>
Still, the back of the shadow knight’s mind would not let go of her fears of what may, even now, be lying in wait for them inside those trees.  To return to this place was foolish, she thought.  But as with so many things, it was a necessary measure.<br>
<br>
Highpass, the Dark Elf repeated in her own mind.  Everything will be fine once we reach Highpass.<br>
<br>
Dreketh flexed her fingers as she pulled the bronze gauntlets over her hands, her thoughts turning more confident.  After all, she might have been worrying over nothing.  A few short hours’ travel through the wood, and perhaps she and Laera really would be drinking toasts to their successful journey. <br>
<br>
Releasing her breath in a loud sigh, Dreketh drew her father’s sword from its place on her back.  “Let’s get this over with,” she muttered, looking into the trees as if facing down a long-time rival.  “And anyway, standing here gawking won’t get us those drinks.”<br>
<br>
Nodding her agreement quietly, Laera followed her companion once more into the tall and hazy shelter of Kithicor Wood.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The cold of the forest bit clear to the bone, even though the sun’s rays shown streaking through the lofty treetops high above.  Laera noticed the chill as soon as she first set foot past the trees standing watch at the wood’s entrance.  It felt as though the first breath of winter chose that very moment to strike without regard to the fact that the season was just starting to give way to its icy clutches.  <br>
<br>
The thought passed briefly through the Wood Elf’s mind that perhaps this temperature was commonplace for Kithicor this time of year.  The thought was dismissed just as quickly.  No, this chill was unnatural.  The chill was surreal and otherworldly.  It was undeniable that something had definitely changed in Kithicor since their last visit, and Laera saw her companion’s dark face grow even darker as evidently she too arrived at the same conclusion.<br>
<br>
The druid kept alert to anything that might have been different or unusual about the forest.  The sound of forest animals tittering and chirping all around was a small comfort, but certainly not out of the ordinary.  The towering trees appeared healthy for a forest this size.  The pathway was slightly less worn than she expected for so much traffic coming in and out of Highpass and Rivervale nearby.  Then again, since the legendary haunting of the forest, most travelers tended to think twice before entering Kithicor after dark these days.<br>
<br>
Clutching her arms about herself, Laera imagined what that battle must have been like – the thunderous conflict between the armies of Firiona Vie, High Elf princess, and Lanys T’Vyl, Daughter of Innoruuk.  The battle literally unlocked the plane of Hate, releasing legions of untold terrors to curse the wood with their foul haunt.  Visions of her previous incident with the undead of Kithicor sprang to mind as well, much to the druid’s dread.  She looked upon the encounter with remorse, remembering how she cowered in the face of the threat, leaving Dreketh to handle things as best she could on her own.  Hardly a ringing endorsement for the druid’s soldiering skills, had she been one of the many called upon to fight alongside Firiona Vie so many years ago.<br>
<br>
Laera shook her head bitterly at the memory, berating herself for falling prey to fear as she had.  At the same time, she cringed at the idea of again facing the undead – the undead and that horrible human necromancer.  What was he called?  The Wood Elf pondered his name.  Kieran.  That was it – Kieran Shadowseek…<br>
<br>
Then it struck her why Dreketh was so tense about reentering the forest.  Glancing next to her, Laera caught sight of a bead of sweat running down the shadow knight’s temple despite the chilled air.  That must have been it.  From what the Wood Elf could gather, the arch-necromancer was never truly killed.  Or perhaps it was best to say Kieran was killed, but wasn’t completely dead.  Dreketh’s words came to the Wood Elf in a flash of memory.  A liche.  It was reputed to be one of the most dangerous and dreadful incarnations of the undead ever known.<br>
<br>
Laera didn’t pretend to understand exactly what it meant, but listening to the shadow knight’s tone of voice as she spoke over the necromancer’s deflated body, she knew the portents were dire.<br>
<br>
“Do you um-“ The Wood Elf cleared her throat, her voice a low whisper.  “Do you sense any undead nearby?”<br>
<br>
“Ignorance is bliss,” Dreketh muttered, her eyes darting from tree to tree.<br>
<br>
“You don’t believe that.”  Laera’s tone was confident.<br>
<br>
“Don’t I?”  The shadow knight looked to her companion and found the druid’s eyes filled with skepticism.  Sighing, Dreketh cupped her hand, muttering several words of magic.  As before, a small orb of light coalesced above her palm.  “I’m glad you’re here to tell me what I believe in,” she commented dryly as she held the light out toward the trees.<br>
<br>
“It’s why you keep me around, isn’t it?” the Wood Elf jibed, trying to keep things light-hearted in the face of her fears.<br>
<br>
“I keep you around for the conversation,” Dreketh said distractedly.<br>
<br>
Laera paused to look at her partner, wondering if she had actually been complimented or the brunt of one of the shadow knight’s caustic jokes.<br>
<br>
Feeling the Wood Elf’s gaze, Dreketh paused in her search.  “And for the free food!” she said, shaking her head in mock annoyance at having to voice the obvious.<br>
<br>
Shaking her own head with a sigh and a crooked grin, Laera consigned herself to never grasping Teir’Dal humor.  “Do you sense anything?” she asked, changing the subject.<br>
<br>
“There are a few small skeletons roaming about,” the Dark Elf said, resuming her search.  “Nothing either of us couldn’t handle on our own, but we both know that can change in a blink.  Have you seen any sign of the ranger lately?”<br>
<br>
“Not a thing, but that doesn’t mean he’s not out there,” the druid craned her neck in the futile attempt at finding their elusive guardian.  “A ranger as skilled as he is could be standing right in front of us, and we’d probably never see him.”<br>
<br>
“Well, he wouldn’t need master tracking skills to follow us,” Dreketh said as she resumed her stride down the path.  The ball of light still hovered above her extended hand.  “Your teeth are chattering louder than a maiden’s on her wedding night.”<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry,” Laera apologized, hugging herself tightly.  “It’s this blasted cold, I can’t help it.  I don’t know how you keep from shivering in that metal armor.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh turned to give the Wood Elf a quizzical look.  “Cold?” she asked curiously.  “What cold?  I figured you were just scared.”<br>
<br>
Casting Dreketh a look of forbearance, Laera brought up one of her hands to brush it against the Dark Elf’s cheek.  <br>
<br>
Gasping in surprise, Dreketh pulled back slightly from the druid’s chill touch. “You’re freezing!” she declared, her brow furrowed.<br>
<br>
“Believe me now?” Laera asked peevishly, placing her fingers beneath her armpits to warm them.<br>
<br>
Concerned at what she was seeing, Dreketh rested her sword against a nearby tree and pulled off one gauntlet to feel the Wood Elf’s forehead and face.  She could detect no sign of a fever, magical or otherwise, but the druid’s nose and ears were definitely cold to the touch.  Unnaturally so, considering the temperate weather.<br>
<br>
“This isn’t good,” she said, pulling on her gauntlet again.<br>
<br>
“What is it?  What’s wrong?” Laera asked, alarmed by the Dark Elf’s sudden concern.<br>
<br>
“I can’t say for sure,” Dreketh said, retrieving her sword.  “But I think you’re being observed.”<br>
<br>
“Observed?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, observed by the undead,” the shadow knight spoke quickly, continuing down the path with a hurried step.  “It’s just a term we use.  It means you’ve managed to catch the attention of a powerful practitioner who means you harm – probably a necromancer.”<br>
<br>
“Are you saying Kieran is after me?” Laera asked.  Trying her best to still her rising panic, she kept pace with her partner.  “But you’re the one he took a ‘liking’ to.  Why would he be after me?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know.”  Dreketh urged the anxious druid along even faster. “But whatever ritual he seeks to cast on you has already begun.  When did you first feel the chill?”<br>
<br>
“As soon as we entered the forest,” Laera answered nervously.<br>
<br>
“Innoruuk’s bane,” Dreketh cursed.  “Why didn’t you say something?”<br>
<br>
“I thought you felt it, too,” the Wood Elf tried to defend herself.  “You looked like you were marching against certain death when we crossed into the trees, back there.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s swift stride came to a sudden stop as the light floating above her hand flared brilliantly to life, lighting her face.  “It seems we are about to.”<br>
<br>
“What is that supposed to…” Laera’s question died on her lips as she looked to the road ahead.<br>
<br>
Illuminated by the radiance of the shadow knight’s spell could be seen a scattering of black, vaporous tendrils as they crept along the ground.  Their slick, winding movements appeared aimless until they gradually began to coagulate, forming into one mass of darkness writhing in agitation along the dusty path.  Growing larger with each passing moment, the mist took on a sentient and malevolent quality as it molded itself into a humanoid shape.  From within the oily vapor emerged a familiar and cunning face, smiling wickedly from the depths of a haggard cowl that shifted about wildly in an unfelt wind.<br>
<br>
Kieran Shadowseek, arch-necromancer of Bertoxxulous, had risen from the grave.<br>
<br>
Hollow laughter emerged seemingly from among the trees all around.  “Welcome home, my dear.  I must say I am deeply honored to see you decided to pay me a visit.”  The disembodied voice resounded in a deep bass, its tone reflecting the wicked cheer seen in the eyes of the former necromancer.  Though his lips remained frozen in their vicious sneer, it was obvious the voice belonged to him.<br>
<br>
Dreketh made no response, standing motionless in the path to stare coldly at the liche hovering before her.  Both hands gripped the hilt of her sword, her spell long since forgotten at the appearance of this old adversary.  <br>
<br>
Laera’s trembling increased visibly by the debilitating fear that engulfed her.  The appearance of Kieran Shadowseek as one of the risen dead overwhelmed her senses as she watched his horrid apparition floating above the ground.  The man’s flesh had shriveled into a pale imitation of life, gray flakes of skin peeling from his hands and once striking face.  The gaunt and wasted form was enshrouded in a tattered cloak that whipped hypnotically in the intangible wind.  The Wood Elf never dreamed such a thing could possibly have existed on Norrath – alive, dead or undead.  The sight was feverishly horrid, and one she knew would stay with her forever.<br>
<br>
“Allow me the courtesy of showing you my gratitude for granting me this second opportunity, my dear,” the lich’s disembodied voice went on to say.  “My debilitated state at our last encounter was scarcely decent, and wholly improper.  As the Plaguebringer would have it, I am now in a far superior condition to offer you His ultimate reward.”  <br>
<br>
The shadow knight remained motionless, her azure eyes glinting.  “You’ll have to go through me first to get to her,” she said.  Though Dreketh’s words bordered on the absurd in the face of such an intractable foe, her voice carried with it a tone of determination that lent the druid a sense of confidence.<br>
<br>
The lich’s evil grin widened ever so slightly.  “It is you whom I address, my dear.  As a fellow practitioner of the dead, it will be my honor to introduce you into our ranks.  Naturally, your services to the Prince of Hate will be at an end as you become an immortal servant of Bertoxxulous.  Fear not.  I am your liberator.  I am your deliverer.”  Kieran’s deep voice lowered to a near-whisper toward the end, turning rapturous in its delivery. “I am your… savior.”<br>
<br>
Laera closed her eyes, shivering uncontrollably.  Fear’s icy touch chilled her even more than the surrounding temperature, causing her to lose touch of her senses.  The lich’s words and those of her companion turned into a jumble of lost meaning as she tried desperately to retain a tentative grasp of her faculties.<br>
<br>
“Don’t insult my intelligence, Kieran,” Dreketh threatened grimly.  “Even now you observe the Wood Elf with your Lord’s twisted sense of ‘deliverance.’  A blind initiate of half a season could see through your pale deceit.”<br>
<br>
“Your naiveté is most endearing.  I will enjoy showing you the unique outlook the undead affords its constituents.”  The lich’s nebulous form turned to gaze to the trees in the distance.  “But first there is a vital matter of retribution to be settled.”<br>
<br>
Spreading his thin arms wide, Kieran’s wasted form was once again entwined in the oily mists.  The tendrils played about the dead necromancer’s body in a spellbinding dance as their ebbs and flow grew higher and higher.  Like smoke to a chimney, the creeping mists gyrated their meandering ascension to the sheltering limbs of the trees, until they too swayed with the unfelt wind of the dead.<br>
<br>
Dreketh watched closely as events unfolded, attempting to divine the purpose behind the lich’s actions.  Though thoroughly versed in living necromancy, she was only loosely familiar with the capabilities of the sentient dead as Kieran had become.  A number of spells came to mind that he could be casting, but the possibilities were many and the Dark Elf resisted the temptation to act until she knew what she was truly up against.<br>
<br>
Lightning flashed along the tendrils, trailing upward into the trees.  Thunder answered the brief flashes instantly afterward, and Dreketh could begin to feel the stirrings of a true wind begin to waft all around her.  Whatever the spell was, it reached beyond the ethereal and touched the physical, but what the end result could possibly be remained a mystery.<br>
<br>
Then the liche spoke.<br>
<br>
“Cah’rem sar, ven’thrak seryth necrum kal’shem-”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf’s eyes widened – the words were Teir’Dal!  Whether or not Kieran was speaking in her native tongue for her benefit, she couldn’t tell, but their meaning was unmistakable.  Suddenly Dreketh shared in the Wood Elf’s chill as realization of what the liche was doing swept over her.  The technique he was using came clearly to mind, as did his intent.  Divination came first, seeking the sundered gateway of the forest.  Then alteration came into play, forcing the gateway’s untimely breach.  And finally…<br>
<br>
“Laera!”  The shadow knight whirled about to find the Wood Elf clutching her head, her eyes squinted shut and trembling like never before.  Dreketh grabbed hold of one wrist, trying to jar the druid out of her panic.  “We need to get out of here!” she called over the quickly rising gale and thunder.  “We must find my father!  He is the only one who can put a stop to this!  Laera, can you hear me!”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf was terrified beyond reason.  “I won’t become one of them,” she whispered to herself.  “I won’t, I won’t, I won’t…”<br>
<br>
“It’s too late to run,” a voice called out from the distance – a mortal voice.<br>
<br>
Looking past the dismayed Wood Elf, Dreketh saw the ranger approaching, rapier in hand.  Though his cloak and the brim of his hat fluttered in the mounting gusts of wind, his step remained calm.<br>
<br>
“The undead of Kithicor already heed the liche’s call,” Ranin Treestalker said, addressing the shadow knight in a loud, commanding voice as he approached.  “In moments this area will be inundated with the ancient minions killed in the forest years ago.  Your only option is to fight, Dark Elf.”<br>
<br>
Blinking in the wind, Dreketh tossed her head to rid her face of her own hair.  “They are servants of hate!” she called back over the bedlam.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” the ranger replied, turning his gaze on the lich.  “But he holds sway over the undead on this world.  Once the undead answer his summons from the Plane of Hate, they will answer only his voice and no other.”<br>
<br>
“My father can banish them,” the Dark Elf insisted.  “We must find him in Highpass and bring him here!”<br>
<br>
“The summons is for your sake, shadow knight!” the ranger spat back.  “You won’t make it fifty yards before the minions of your own master engulf you!  See!”  He raised a gloved hand, pointing at a cavorting skeleton emerging from the trees, heading directly for them.  “I can hold them off, but I will need your help keeping back the weaker ones!”<br>
<br>
Understanding the ranger’s ad hoc plan, Dreketh nodded and turned back to the petrified druid.  Laera’s posture hadn’t changed, and the Dark Elf was forced to grab the Wood Elf’s arms vehemently to break her of the insensate panic.<br>
<br>
“Laera!  Laera, listen to me!” Dreketh shouted, bringing her face in close.  The druid’s terror-filled eyes reluctantly met hers, the emerald green irises dilated in fear.  “You must run to Highpass and bring my father here!  He is the only one who can stop them!  Do you understand?  Find him and bring him here!  Do you hear me?  Bring him here!”<br>
<br>
Laera cringed at another flash of lighting, her eyes closing shut again.<br>
<br>
“Do you understand!” Dreketh yelled, determined not to let the Wood Elf slip into fear’s grip a second time.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf nodded, her hair flying about her head wildly.<br>
<br>
“Hurry!  We won’t last long!”  The shadow knight led Laera a short distance down the path, toward Highpass.  “Run as fast as you can and don’t look back!”<br>
<br>
The bone-crushing sound of a skeleton flying apart split the air, and both young women turned in time to see the ranger’s blade finish its vicious arc.  Pieces of bone whirled about in the heedless wind to land in shards at his feet.  Glancing up, the ranger cast Dreketh an impatient glance.  The undead were fast closing in on their position, and time was of the essence.<br>
<br>
“Go!” she shouted, giving her companion a brutal shove.  “Go now!”<br>
<br>
Laera stumbled briefly, catching sight of the lich towering above her on the path.  The awesome sight made her heart leap into her throat.  She was convinced the intimidating creature was about to devour her on the spot.  As her vision cleared, however, she found his head tilted back, arms outstretched as he was lost in the casting of the horrible spell.  The inky vapor rose all about him now, twisting like a seething dust devil rising to the heavens with their shrieking call to the dead.<br>
<br>
“Run!”  Dreketh’s voice rose above the wind, accompanied by another flash of lightning.<br>
<br>
Laera bolted into action.  She ran down the path, her legs pumping with all the energy she could muster, knowing that with every footfall she was that much farther from the liche and his malevolent power.  With every breath, she was closer to safety.<br>
<br>
Or was she?  Thoughts raced through her head frantically in her flight.  What if the liche decided to send the undead after her?  After all, she was the one who was helpless and alone now.  What would happen when she encountered the undead that were en route?  What was to stop them from killing her on their way to destroy Dreketh?  <br>
<br>
Her questions were lost in the sound of her companion’s voice calling to her – her concerns drowned in the urgency of Dreketh’s plea to find her father.  He was the key.  He was the only one who could send those undead away and kill the liche.  Literally, she was their only chance for survival – Dreketh and the ranger, Ranin Treestalker.<br>
<br>
Collecting her full efforts, Laera pushed herself harder, careening uncontrollably down the path toward the west.  Toward Highpass.  Toward hope.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dreketh seized the handle of her sword in both hands with a vice-like grip.  She watched as the Wood Elf disappeared around a bend in the road, her lips whispering a silent prayer to Innoruuk that the druid would find her father before it was too late.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, there was work to be done.  Stepping back to press against the ranger’s shoulder blades with her own, she mirrored his stance as they both faced down the emerging undead.  <br>
<br>
Glancing at the liche to one side, a thought occurred to her.<br>
<br>
“Do you think you can beat him?” she asked over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
The ranger’s gaze went to the liche as well.  “I don’t know,” he admitted.  “I’ve never fought one of these things before, and I’m sure as hell not going to interrupt him now to find out.  In his vanity, he hungers to have you under his control.  It was his dying thought, and I get the feeling that’s why we’re still alive right now.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh detected a hint of fear in the ranger’s usually cool and collective tone.  She could feel his labored breathing against her back – more labored than was warranted by his exertions thus far.  She realized the man was scared.<br>
<br>
“What do you need me to do?” she asked in a deliberately calm voice, hoping to soothe the man’s nerves.<br>
<br>
“Watch my back and take down the weaker ones,” came the ranger’s raspy voice.  “I’ll deal with the stronger ones as they emerge, but you must keep me from being overwhelmed.  Conserve your strength at first and use your Touch only if absolutely necessary.”<br>
<br>
“Understood,” replied the shadow knight, her sword rising at the sight of a zombie emerging from the trees.  <br>
<br>
Reaching down, Dreketh scooped up a handful of bones from the skeleton the ranger had already dispatched.  Closing her gauntleted fist over the white fragments, she whispered several words of power and tossed them to the ground before her.  One by one, the bones came together, forming a skeletal figure standing before her, its eye sockets glowing with an unholy light.  <br>
<br>
Groping behind her, Dreketh tried to locate one of the ranger’s knives resting on his belt, her eyes never leaving the advancing zombie.<br>
<br>
“Don’t get the wrong idea,” she announced, feeling along his belt and any surrounding body regions her probing fingers encountered.  “You may be easy on the eyes for a Human, but don’t think I’m getting fresh or anything.”  At last, her hand found a serrated dagger and slid it carefully out of its securing strap.  <br>
<br>
“What a shame,” the ranger muttered back just as he took another swing with his sword at some unseen threat on his side.<br>
<br>
Dreketh grinned, her eyes reflecting a wicked mirth as she watched the zombie’s slow and ungainly approach toward her.  Tossing the dagger around in midair to take it by the blade, the Dark Elf slapped the weapon’s hilt into her pet’s bony clutches.  Skeletal fingers immediately wrapped around the handle as the creature let out a maniacal giggle, its glowing eyes eerily focused on its master, seeking instructions.<br>
<br>
More undead emerged from the trees behind the zombie in multitudes more numerous than she cared to count, and she knew even more undead were on their way.  Skeletons, mummies, zombies and ghouls began surrounding the two of them on all sides, their relentless journey toward their prey unwavering.  Among their number were the unusually large dread wolves, their pelts black as night.  Their long noses sniffed the air and the ground, seeking the blood for which their undead wardens thirsted.  <br>
<br>
First things first, Dreketh thought to herself.  The zombie was nearly within striking distance.  Raising one hand to point at the walking corpse, Dreketh spoke a single command to her skeletal minion.<br>
<br>
“Pet… attack.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fire blazed in the druid’s lungs.  Not daring to spare a single moment to rest, Laera pressed herself beyond her body’s limits to reach the far end of the wood, fear being her prime source of impetus.  Not so much fear for her own safety anymore – the few undead she did encounter on the path seemed focused on answering the liche’s call to the exclusion of all else – but rather for Dreketh.  Several minutes ago she had left the ringing sounds of clashing metal behind, knowing that every passing second meant yet another horrid creature for her companion and the ranger to fend off.<br>
<br>
Time was as precious as platinum, and she could feel it slipping through her fingers quickly.  Already more minutes had passed than she could afford, wasted as her weakling legs struggled against the escalating gravity of the forest floor the longer she ran.  Every breath brought in less air.  Every footfall turned to lead.  It seemed the more time went by, the slower the trees passed no matter how much effort she gave it.  The trail before her twisted cruelly among the trees and hills of the forest, disappearing into the pervasive haze.<br>
<br>
The muscles of her throat constricted painfully as she swallowed the viscous saliva forming in her mouth.  Her side ached abominably, and she pressed her hand against the twisting muscles that threatened to double her over.   It wouldn’t be much longer before she collapsed altogether from exhaustion.<br>
<br>
“No!” she cried aloud.  Such thoughts were self-defeating.  She rid her mind of them and focused all her efforts on the next step she took – then the next, and the next.<br>
<br>
Blood pounded in her head.  Laera could feel the veins in her temples pulsate with the labored beating of her heart.  The ground seemed to tilt and whirl around her until the erratic motion made her queasy, forcing her to reach out and lean against one of the many tree trunks close by.  Gasping for air, the druid fended off waves of nausea, willing her body to get a grip on itself so she could continue.<br>
<br>
Between heartbeats echoing through her ears, the druid heard the faint sound of voices in the distance.  At first she thought her mind was playing tricks on her, but the more she caught her breath, the more distinct the sounds became.  There was no doubt – it really was the sound of voices she heard.<br>
<br>
Raising her head wearily, she looked in all directions to take in her surroundings.  As expected, she found clusters of trees, brush and sun-streaked mist encircling her.  Up ahead, however, the greenery gave way to a mass of loose stone as the path rose over a small incline.  Taking a deep breath, Laera silently whispered a word of thanks as she dragged her feet over the ground once again.  She was finally entering the canyon that led straight into Highpass Hold.<br>
<br>
As her clouded vision continued to clear, she saw movement up ahead.  Undoubtedly, these people were the source of the voices she heard.  Vague shapes milled about just outside the mouth of the canyon – a hunting party perhaps, or maybe a group of travelers debating whether to enter the woods so late in the afternoon.  The druid’s spirits rose.  Perhaps they could run to Dreketh’s aid while she tried to locate the shadow knight’s father.  Laera redoubled her efforts and eagerly ran ahead.<br>
<br>
The persistent throbbing of her heart skipped a beat as she approached, her expression turning to one of foreboding.  Among the armored rabble she saw the blue skin of a Teir’Dal.  Inspecting the others more carefully, she realized she had stumbled upon an entire party of Dark Elves either entering or leaving the Highpass mountain region.<br>
<br>
The gravel shifted beneath her feet as she ground to a sudden halt.  They mustn’t see her!  They were far enough away from the boundaries of the stronghold that she was fair game, prey to their whims should they capture her.  <br>
<br>
Glancing quickly to the foliage, Laera considered diving for cover, but it was too late.  At hearing the Wood Elf skid to a standstill, one of the group members pointed her direction, alerting the party to her presence.  Voices rose and weapons were drawn as the rabble hurried forward to intercept the lone druid.<br>
<br>
The fevered notion of drawing her staff was squelched the moment she considered it.  There must have been at least ten or twelve Dark Elves rushing her from atop the hill.  At peak performance she could never hope to best that many, much less attempt it after a forced sprint over a winding road.  Fleeing was out of the question as well – she doubted she had the energy to outrun a turtle lying on its back.  Any spell she could cast to aid in an escape would take an inordinate length of time to complete before the Dark Elves overtook her.<br>
<br>
It was impossible, she realized.  The party of Teir’Dal was moments away from capturing or killing her, and she had absolutely no recourse left at her disposal, save for one.<br>
<br>
Falling to her knees in defeat, Laera felt the solid ground rise up to meet her in a cloud of dust floating about her legs.  Any efforts to slow her strenuous breathing proved unsuccessful as she forced herself to bow her head and close her eyes.  Crossing her arms, she quickly brought her hands to rest against her chest in the fashion of the vellin sar, taught her by Dreketh.<br>
<br>
The approaching footfalls grew louder, as did the Wood Elf’s fear at realizing she couldn’t remember the complex Teir’Dal words of the ritual.  She had only spoken them once before, and that was months ago in a very different time.  Working her mind feverishly, she tried to recall the words, but to no avail.  She did, however, clearly remember their translation in the common tongue.  Wincing, expecting the first blow to fall any second, she opened her mouth to speak.<br>
<br>
“Mine honor shown, thy honor served.”  The frightened druid was forced to whisper, unable to find her winded voice.  “Mine honor shown, thy honor served.  Mine honor shown, thy honor served.”  Her tension rose with every repetition, expecting each phrase to be the last words on her lips.  Gasping for air, the Wood Elf’s whispers gradually faded until even she could no longer hear them.  Her lips continued to mouth the words silently as she knelt trembling on the ground, waiting for the end to arrive.<br>
<br>
Her final thoughts were of bitter regret, how she had failed to find Dreketh’s father in time.<br>
<br>
Before long, Laera realized she could no longer hear the approaching footfalls of her attackers.  Scarcely daring to move a muscle, she opened one eye to see what might have happened.  The fleeting idea that Tunare might have struck them all down crossed her mind, but was put to rest as she saw a crowd of legs surrounding her like a curtain.<br>
<br>
All was silent.  The taciturn Wood Elf opened her other eye and looked up to find Teir’Dal faces all around, their expressions grim and uncertain.  Weapons once held at the ready, eager for blood, dangled in limp, blue hands.  Many of the Dark Elves glanced at their colleagues, wondering what to do next.  Obviously, this was the first time a Wood Elf had ever performed the vellin var, or even showed any knowledge of the Teir’Dal ritual of trust.  <br>
<br>
Nobody was at all certain if they were witness to devout solemnity, or blatant heresy.  Here was a light-dweller, an enemy of the blood, kneeling before them performing this sacred ritual used exclusively between Dark Elves.  Many felt they should be outraged at such a desecration.  On the other hand, the vellin sar was the vellin sar – sacrosanct in its sincerity of trust.  The situation was baffling, to say the least.<br>
<br>
Through the hesitant confusion felt within the small gathering, all eyes eventually turned toward one prominent Teir’Dal approaching with a measured step from farther up the path – presumably the leader of the group.  Laera’s clear, green eyes gazed up at the towering Dark Elf, clad resplendent in shining armor, his head hidden in a helm crafted from steel to closely resemble a horned skull.<br>
<br>
“What is the meaning of this?”  The man’s voice was deep for a Dark Elf, his words as measured as his steps as he came to a stop mere inches from the kneeling Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
“She speaks the words of the vellin sar, my Lord Seryth,” one of the others said in a respectful tone.<br>
<br>
Behind his silvery mask, the leader’s eyes slid to focus on the Dark Elf who spoke.  “In words of the Teir’Dal?” he asked, his voice imperious.<br>
<br>
“No, my lord.  She speaks in the common tongue, but the words are unmistakable.”  The man’s gaze returned down to stare incredulously at the trembling Wood Elf before him.  “She invokes the vellin sar!”<br>
<br>
Lord Seryth responded in kind, inspecting Laera closely with a dangerous look.  <br>
<br>
The chill returned to Laera in a rush.  The beads of sweat that dappled her skin mingled with raised goose bumps, causing her to tremble even more at the icy cold.  The Wood Elf’s pleading eyes never wavered, however, as they looked up at those of the Teir’Dal lord.<br>
<br>
Seryth raised a hand to stroke his chin thoughtfully, his fingertips playing about the light fuzz that passed for an Elven beard.  Stepping forward, he quietly scrutinized Laera in profile, his men backing away respectfully to allow their leader the room he required.<br>
<br>
“Impressive, Wood Elf,” he said speculatively.  “Where did you chance across the vellin sar, hmm?  Eavesdropping on the battlefield, perhaps?”<br>
<br>
Laera was about to answer, but the Dark Elf interrupted.  Squatting down next to her, he spoke softly into her ear. <br>
<br>
“Or were you schooled by some traitorous bastard Elf-lover?” Seryth asked.  A smile crossed his thin lips at seeing a flash cross Laera’s features.  “Ah, I see I’m not far from the truth.  I wonder… who would do such a thing?”<br>
<br>
Laera swallowed nervously, a bead of sweat rolling down a tendril of hair as it clung to her cheek.  Seeing her reluctance, Seryth grabbed a handful of the Wood Elf’s hair in his hand, pulling her head back with a painful jerk.  Laera gasped, a slight yelp escaping her control.<br>
<br>
“Even more disturbing,” Lord Seryth continued, tightening his grip with every word, “what sort of arrogant, presumptuous weakling would dare desecrate the vellin sar by invoking its words with nothing but fey blood?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s chest heaved in shallow gasps from the pain, her mouth wide in a silent cry.   Reaching behind her head, she pulled at the lord’s unyielding hand.<br>
<br>
“But she forgot one important detail, didn’t she?” Seryth called out to his mates.  Laera cringed as the Dark Elf’s abrupt voice hurt her ears.  Grim laughter from the group answered Seryth’s question, and he wrenched the Wood Elf’s hair even harder as he spoke again.  “You still wear your armor, woodie!  It is a sign of mistrust unless you’re with your comrades on the battlefield.”  <br>
<br>
The Dark Elf brutally forced Laera to look at the area surrounding the group.  “Does this look like a battlefield to you!” he asked, his voice rising once more.  Tears formed in her eyes, a sob escaping her lips as she tried desperately to evade the grinning faces of her captors looking down at her.<br>
<br>
Seryth deftly twisted her head to look at him.  “Do I look like your comrade?  I think not.”<br>
<br>
Laera closed her eyes, surrendering herself to uncontrolled sobs as the Dark Elf’s cruel face blurred in her vision.  “Please don’t kill me,” she pleaded.  “I can’t die now.  Please…”<br>
<br>
Seryth brought her face within inches of his nose.  “You… are… not… Teir’Dal.”  He spoke succinctly.  “You haven’t the right to invoke the vellin sar.  Not for us.  Not for anyone on Norrath!”<br>
<br>
His muscles bulging, the Dark Elf lord pulled hard on the druid’s hair, lifting it high in the air.  Shrieking, Laera was forced to stand or risk losing it in a most agonizing way.  Bringing his other hand forward, Seryth slammed the heel of his palm against the center of the Wood Elf’s chest, causing her to stumble backwards.  Two Dark Elves – one male, one female – caught her in their clutches, forcing her to remain standing.<br>
<br>
“If you were Teir’Dal, you would understand that there are worse things than death,” Seryth said, lecturing his captive as he drew his long-bladed weapon from its scabbard.  “You would know how to properly invoke the vellin sar, and your very nature would have demanded it!”<br>
<br>
Affable cheers from the group accompanied Lord Seryth’s words, the matter having been settled for them.  Now that the bounds of proper etiquette were firmly set in place by their leader, the assembled Teir’Dal eagerly looked forward to discovering the fate he had in store for the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
Laera suppressed a wince as she felt the Dark Elf’s blade slip beneath the left strap of her tunic at her side.  The polished metal slid smoothly against her skin, and the Wood Elf forced herself to remain still, lest the blade’s edge cut her.<br>
<br>
“It is my privilege to show you how to supplicate yourself properly before the Teir’Dal, and beg our mercy,” Seryth said with an eager grin.  With a flick of his wrist, the blade sliced neatly through the strap, causing both severed ends to dangle uselessly against her hip.  “We will gladly show you the proper way to invoke the vellin sar, won’t we?”  The blade returned, this time sliding underneath her left shoulder strap.  “So next time you can get it right, as you kneel before the Prince of Hate to beg His mercy…” <br>
<br>
The blade twisted against Laera’s collarbone, maneuvering itself over the curves of her shoulder to emerge marred with blood on other side of the strap.  <br>
<br>
The female holding her left arm leaned forward to speak softly in the Wood Elf’s ear.  “Relax, girl.  Struggling will only make the blade penetrate deeper… among other things.”<br>
<br>
Laera screeched aloud, her voice shrill in the trees.  The Dark Elves laughed their merriment at the Wood Elf’s torment until they realized their leader’s voice had joined hers.  Contrary to first impressions, both were cries of pain, and Lord Seryth released his grip on his weapon, causing it to slide out from under the leather strap and fall to the rocky path with a metallic clang.<br>
<br>
Seryth cursed through clenched teeth, holding his right hand tightly.  His eyes widened as he saw his sword begin to glow red as it rested on the ground.  Small clusters of grass burst into flame next to the superheated weapon.<br>
<br>
“What in the name of hate…” Seryth’s voice trailed off.  <br>
<br>
Turning in a half-crouch as he nursed his scorched hand, the Teir’Dal lord looked back to find another Dark Elf standing on the rocky path above.  Clad in flowing brown robes of varying shades and patterns, the figure stared down at the small assemblage with two distinct pairs of eyes – two of his own, and two emblazoned at his chest.<br>
<br>
“The Wood Elf is under my protection,” the newcomer stated, his voice authoritative.  “The next individual to lay a weapon on her will find their skin melting, and not their blade.”<br>
<br>
Seryth glanced down to find his sword glowing white, its shape twisting slightly to the contours of the path.  Snarling his outrage, the Dark Elf kicked at the ruined weapon, sending it flying through the air in a flurry of sparks to land among the rocks at the robed figure’s feet.<br>
<br>
“And who are you to tell us our business!” he spat.  “We will kill whatever light-dweller we wish, when we wish, in whatever manner we wish!”  Seryth made a gesture and several party members began approaching the hill to apprehend this seditious spell caster.<br>
<br>
The robed Teir’Dal merely closed his eyes, his face placid and untroubled by the odds against him.  Without word or ceremony, the Dark Elf cast his spell, causing Lord Seryth to grasp at his chest.  Muffled sounds emitted from his constricting form as he tried to speak.<br>
<br>
“Release the Wood Elf, fools, or your ‘lord’ dies now,” the robed figure said calmly.<br>
<br>
Unwilling to challenge the newcomer’s threat, the two Dark Elves holding Laera released her and backed away hurriedly.  The unfettered druid fell to her knees once again, her hands going immediately to the strap on her shoulder, holding it away from her burned and blistering skin where the blade had touched her.  Similarly, Seryth followed suit as he too fell to his knees, gasping for air.<br>
<br>
The crowd of Dark Elves was thoroughly cowed by the newcomer’s display of power.  None dared make a move as the man stepped quietly into their ranks and approached the injured Wood Elf.  <br>
<br>
“Laera Nellynwae,” he said in a stern voice.  Laera glanced up, surprised at hearing her name spoken by this strange Dark Elf.  “I am Xon Quexill, custodian of the Pact.”<br>
<br>
Lord Seryth’s eyes turned up in recognition, his face twisted in a malicious sneer aimed at the guild master’s back.<br>
<br>
The druid’s jaw dropped, her eyes wide.  “Dreketh’s father…” she whispered fervently.<br>
<br>
“After a fashion,” Quexill said, holding his hand out to assist the Wood Elf.  Laera placed one hand in his, the other still holding her tunic away from the hideous burn on her shoulder as she stood.  “I regret not arriving to meet you sooner,” he went on to say, his tone cold and officious.  “I feel responsible for the consequences you have suffered on my account.  Hold quite still.”<br>
<br>
Before Laera could move away, the Dark Elf placed his hand over the wound, causing it to sting terribly.  The Wood Elf drew in a sharp breath while the air all around split with a single loud crack.  Instantly the pain was gone, and Quexill removed his hand to reveal her normal healthy skin.<br>
<br>
Staring down at her shoulder in disbelief, Laera ran her fingers over the newly restored skin.  “Healing?” she asked breathlessly.<br>
<br>
“Not precisely.”  Quexill drew the neck of his robe aside to show his own shoulder red and blistering where the Wood Elf’s injury had been.  <br>
<br>
Laera couldn’t believe her eyes.  “I can’t let you do that,” she whispered, reaching forth her hand.  “Let me heal the wound completely and the burn will be gone…”<br>
<br>
“No!” Quexill grasped the druid’s wrist, holding it at bay.  <br>
<br>
Laera flinched at the man’s sudden outburst.  Seeing the tension in his eyes, she was reminded of Dreketh’s violent reaction to being touched by the druid’s healing power for the first time in Nektulos.  <br>
<br>
“No,” the Dark Elf repeated quietly.  “That won’t be necessary.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf pulled her hand away, nodding her understanding.<br>
<br>
“Now then,” Xon Quexill said, replacing the brown fabric of his robe over his shoulder.  “Take me to Dreketh.  Time is short.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The door to the burned-out cabin broke from its hinges with a tumultuous crash.  The shadow knight burst through it to land on her back in the center of the blackened room.  The otherworldly cries of her attacker outside thundered over the rickety structure, causing pieces of wood and soot to rain from the ceiling.  <br>
<br>
Regaining her senses, Dreketh rolled to one side, deftly avoiding the bolt of fire unleashed at her through the open doorway.  Favoring her left arm, the Dark Elf raised her right to extend her hand, palm forward, toward the shaft of sunlight coming through the entrance.  Whispering several dark words, she became enveloped in a yellow glow.  Strength returned to her muscles and energy swept through her body as she drained what was left of the unnatural life force from the undead creature outside.<br>
<br>
Pausing a moment to catch her breath, Dreketh swiped blood from her forehead with the back of her hand.  Though her gauntlets could hardly substitute for a simple rag, at least it kept the blood from flowing over her eyes.  Long ago she used up her daily dose of the shadow knight’s Touch, and even longer ago she had lost her skeletal minion to a scattering of splinters.  Relentlessly, the undead kept coming in droves to answer the call of the liche.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the battle started turning awry, the ranger began to steer the fight in a westerly direction toward Highpass in the hopes that help would reach them all that much sooner.  Between skirmishes, Dreketh tried to keep an eye on the path leading into the distance, hoping in vain that she would see her father approaching at any minute.  <br>
<br>
Now she lay in the scorched remains of someone’s home deep in the heart of Kithicor, having lost the path and any sense of direction she may have had early on.  More than once, the ranger called them both into a forced retreat that led them in whatever course was available at the moment.  It afforded them a sliver of time to renew their strength before having to defend themselves against some other twisted creature of the dead bent on their destruction.<br>
<br>
Or at least the ranger’s destruction.  As the fighting escalated, it became increasingly obvious that the undead were intent on incapacitating or capturing the shadow knight for their transient master.  Dreketh soon came to an uneasy empathy with the Wood Elf’s fear of the undead, now that she herself was the target of their insidious designs.<br>
<br>
A shadow obscured the entrance, casting the entire room into darkness.  Raising her hand, the Dark Elf squinted in the light to try and make out what it was, hoping that it might have been the ranger come to take up a defensive position indoors.  <br>
<br>
At recognizing the silhouette of a skeletal soldier stepping its way inside, Dreketh collapsed.  The fight was over.  She had lost too much blood to put up any semblance of a fight, and her magic was exhausted.  Not that she would have been able to offer any resistance anyway – this creature was way out of her league to begin with.  The undead of Kithicor were exceptional fighters and greatly feared by most of Norrath’s inhabitants.  Only experienced fighters of many seasons could stand up to them, and even then many would be hard-pressed to withstand an onslaught of such magnitude.<br>
<br>
Floorboards creaked in grievance at the soldier’s heavy steps as it entered, the door on the ground breaking into fragments beneath the booted feet.  Dreketh did her best to back away while at the same time scrambling to her feet.  Cursing under her breath, the shadow knight swore she would not be defeated while lying on the floor like some helpless newborn.  With effort, she gained her footing and staggered against the back wall of the cabin, holding herself erect with her good arm on the charred wood. <br>
<br>
Hunched over, Dreketh turned to face the approaching soldier, her back to the wall.  “Come on you dead bastard.  Come get me,” she taunted between breaths.  Licking blood from her lower lip, the shadow knight sneered her defiance.  “There’s nowhere else to go, so let’s finish this!  You and me, right now.  Come on!”<br>
<br>
With a short groan as its only warning, the charred wooden panel Dreketh leaned against gave way, making her stumble.  Shafts of sunlight pierced the shadows through the hole to glint off the Dark Elf’s scraped and abused bracer.<br>
<br>
Sparing the slightest of glances toward the soldier to gauge its distance, Dreketh ignored the pain of her injuries and slammed her shoulder into the wall.  More soot fell from the ceiling, accompanied by another groan from the cabin’s framework.  Another blow and the charred wall began to yield, but only by a few scant inches.  <br>
<br>
At this rate she would never break it down in time.  Undaunted, the shadow knight braced herself to deliver another blow when the cabin’s structure creaked of its own accord.  Mystified, Dreketh looked up to the vaulted ceiling, wondering what was happening an instant before it split apart in a blur of debris and fur.  A furious growl blended with the crashing sounds of wood and plaster hitting the floor , continuing to break the silence after the tumult ceased.<br>
<br>
Raising her head from under her shielding arms, Dreketh peered through the clouds of dust to find a large gray wolf standing between her and the soldier, its hackles raised in defense of the Dark Elf.  Teeth bared and framed by a twisted muzzle, the wolf growled ferociously from deep within its throat – a dire warning to her would-be attacker.<br>
<br>
Heedless of the wolf’s impassioned counsel, the solder pressed its advance, causing the wolf to bark out loud.  Any sane creature would have turned and run for its life, confronted by such ferocity, but the skeletal soldier paid it no mind.  Its attention remained focused solely on the shadow knight. <br>
<br>
The wolf would not be ignored.  Drawing back on its haunches, it leapt through the air to collide against the soldier’s rusted chest plate, its slavering jowls snapping madly.  Together, cryptic undead and wild beast wrestled with each other in a frenzied struggle of twists and lunges in the center of the room.  Dreketh backed herself against the wall for fear of being swept up in the heedless violence.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh, are you in there!” a female called from outside.<br>
<br>
Recognizing the Laera’s voice, Dreketh turned in amazement to address the wall.  “Yes!  I’m here!” she called back.  <br>
<br>
Through the hole in the wall, she could see a jumble of tans and browns moving haphazardly in the sun.  Glowing specks of dust in the air vanished as the sunlight was suddenly obscured from the other side.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh!”  The Wood Elf’s concerned face appeared roughly a foot away from the hole.<br>
<br>
“I’m pinned against the wall!  Help me break it down!”  The shadow knight’s mounting panic was audible.  <br>
<br>
“There’s a huge beam holding it together out here!  Hold on!” Laera yelled back, her face disappearing.<br>
<br>
Swallowing hard, Dreketh cast an uneasy glance at the wolf and soldier as she waited impatiently.  Neither side of the struggle was giving any ground whatsoever.  If anything, the battle grew more heated the longer it went on.<br>
<br>
“Okay, push!” the Wood Elf called, her voice strained.<br>
<br>
Dreketh slammed her shoulder into the wall again, this time gaining several inches as it gave way even further.  Whatever the druid was doing seemed to be working.<br>
<br>
“Again!” Laera grunted.<br>
<br>
The wall shuddered another time, the wood splintering in a jagged crack where the shadow knight struck from inside.  The sudden opening took Dreketh by surprise, causing her to overextend and lose her balance.  The Dark Elf stumbled forward to trip over a good-sized log resting about knee height on the other side.   that refused to budge.  Her armored hands stretched through the newly opened gap to feel about awkwardly in the late afternoon air.<br>
<br>
Firm hands on the other side grabbed hold of them reassuringly.  <br>
<br>
“Hold tight, I have you!” the Wood Elf yelled, steadying her companion.<br>
<br>
Her balance regained, Dreketh stepped over the unyielding log, and blinking, emerged into the filtered sunlight.  Weakened from its injuries, her other foot didn’t clear the log entirely, sending her pitching forward into the druid.  <br>
<br>
Anticipating the fall, Laera caught the Dark Elf in her arms.  “Relax, you’re out.  I have you,” she said, dragging her companion away from the wall to rest against a small tree stump.<br>
<br>
At that moment, the Wood Elf’s voice was the most beautiful thing Dreketh had ever heard.  “I was certain I was finished in there,” she croaked, her voice spent.  “It had me.  It had me cold until the wolf…”<br>
<br>
An agonized yelp rang out from inside the cabin, as if bidden by the shadow knight’s words.  Both companions looked up to see the house’s framework shudder from some unseen force.  The ceiling caved in several feet, sending splinters of wood in every direction.  With a sickening groan, the walls teetered in one direction to fall to the ground with a thunderous crash.  Clouds of dust and soot billowed out from under the rubble, sweeping over the young women like a noxious fog rolling in from some cursed storm at sea.<br>
<br>
Bereft of nearly all their senses, the companions could do nothing but cough and choke in the debilitating cloud.  Their vision obscured, their hearing drowned by the sound of falling lumber, and their noses overwhelmed with the overpowering smell of burnt cinder, the two took solace in each other’s touch as they waited for the black haze to clear.<br>
<br>
Gagging, Laera could barely make out the shape of an animal as it emerged from the fallen debris, limping with a feeble step.  The creature seemed to be a large, gray wolf, its fur disheveled and covered with streaks of blood in places.  Its pinkish tongue hung from its muzzle on one side as it made its weary way toward them.<br>
<br>
“Great Mother of All, is that…?”  Laera cast Dreketh a questioning look, which was answered with a weak nod.<br>
<br>
Wasting no time, the Wood Elf shuffled forward to meet the wolf’s battered form, the creature collapsing to the ground before her in exhaustion.  With quick and efficient hands, Laera pulled the animal’s head into her lap, inspecting its wounds closely.<br>
<br>
“It’s okay,” she said in a soft, comforting voice as she ran her fingers through the gray fur.  “It’s all right.  You’re safe now – we all are.  Hold still while I…”<br>
<br>
“Save your magic, druid of Tunare,” the wolf spoke, its speech slurring awkwardly from the elongated muzzle.  “Your feeble power wouldn’t make enough difference to matter at this point and would be better served in the care of others.  Save it for the living.”  <br>
<br>
Closing its eyes, the wolf’s body transformed before her until it was the ranger whose head lay cradled in the Wood Elf’s lap.  Blood continued to flow from the man’s wounds, forming a small puddle on the grassy forest floor.  <br>
<br>
“Ranin…” Laera whispered, seeing the ranger’s face clearly for the first time, without the ever-present hat to shadow it from the light.<br>
<br>
The man’s attractive features were marred by a ghastly scar running the length of his face from forehead to neck, and presumably even lower beneath the collar of his tunic.  Otherwise, Ranin Treestalker possessed some of the most ruggedly handsome looks Laera had ever seen on a Human or any other race.<br>
<br>
The ranger’s eyes rolled as he blinked, his throat constricting in a meager swallow.  “You found the Dark Elf’s father?” he asked in his usual rasping voice.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf’s eyes filled with tears as she stroked the man’s thick brown hair.  Forcing a smile to her lips, she nodded.  “Yes.  Yes I did.”<br>
<br>
“The liche…?”  The ranger coughed, blood welling to his mouth.<br>
<br>
A single tear fell from the druid’s eyelashes.  “Gone.  Or it soon will be.”  Laera looked off into the distance where she left Xon Quexill to deal with the foul creature.  “But the undead are all scattered now.  We’re safe.”<br>
<br>
The ranger let out a sigh of relief, eyelids half-closing as his gaze grew abstracted.<br>
<br>
The druid wet her lips, accompanied by a small sniffle.  “Why did you do this, Ranin?  Why did you strive to protect us this whole time?” she asked in a tremulous voice that fell to a whisper.  “I have to know.  Please tell me.”<br>
<br>
A small grin crossed the man’s bloodstained lips.  “I told you before – because of love,” he said weakly.<br>
<br>
“I don’t understand,” Laera said confusedly.<br>
<br>
The ranger’s grin broadened.  “You will.”  His eyes turned to look over at the shadow knight resting several feet away.  “All too soon, you will.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf followed his gaze, the meaning of his words hitting her squarely in her chest.<br>
<br>
“Now go,” he said, his voice suddenly sharp.  “The sooner you reach Highpass, the safer you’ll be.”<br>
<br>
“I can’t just leave you here to die alone,” Laera protested.<br>
<br>
“Who said anything about dying?”  The ranger’s wry grin returned, gracing his face for several moments before turning serious once again.  “Please, you must leave or I will be lost.  Go…quickly.”<br>
<br>
The druid’s brow contorted in indecision, unsure of whether or not to believe the man’s words.  Blood flowed heavily from his wounds while even more blood spilled from his lips, indicating severe internal injury as well.  So far as she could tell, it was a miracle he was even still breathing.  Moving him was out of the question, and he expected her to believe that he would be okay out here alone with the sun setting in little over two or three hours?<br>
<br>
She was about to refuse the ranger’s request when she caught sight of his eyes staring intently into hers.  It was the look of a fervent man who would accept no dissention.  She had seen the look in the eyes of many of Tunare’s followers in the past – a look she herself once held and had since become estranged.  It shocked her to see it in the eyes of Ranin Treestalker, but she knew that he would not be denied.<br>
<br>
Leaning down, Laera kissed the ranger’s forehead softly.  “Thank you for everything you’ve done for us,” she whispered, her soot-stained lips brushing against his skin as she spoke.<br>
<br>
The ranger merely nodded, accepting her thanks silently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The advocate of Tunare walked off into the distance, supporting the advocate of Innoruuk with one arm around her shoulders.  The ranger watched placidly as the two disappeared into the trees and mist, heading in the direction of the Dark Elf’s father – to safety.  Or at the very least, as much safety as could be expected for two people who were actively being hunted by nearly every god holding sway over Norrath.<br>
<br>
Ranin Treestalker let his head fall back to rest gently on the ground.  He was dying.  There was no point in denying it now as he felt his life slip from his grasp with each heartbeat.  Blood flowed from his injuries freely to mingle with the grass and leaves on the forest floor.<br>
<br>
“The cycle continues,” he muttered as he watched in fascination his own blood seeping into the ground.  <br>
<br>
“As with all things, cherished one, you return to the soil from which you were made,” the voice of Erollisi Marr spoke in his mind.  “Mortal life ceases and its consequence sparks off mortal life anew while the immortal soul continues its eternal ascendancy.”<br>
<br>
“Tell me my death serves more than that, Mistress,” Ranin said, looking off in the distance where the two young women vanished.  <br>
<br>
“It shall, beloved,” the goddess answered.  “Your devotion has ensured the prophecy’s fulfillment.”<br>
<br>
The ranger’s head turned back to rest against the ground once more, his eyes gazing up into the darkening haze of the forest.  The evening was still young.  He idly wondered if the light of the sky was truly growing dim, or if it was his own vision failing.<br>
<br>
“The Chalice…?” he whispered, his voice barely audible.<br>
<br>
“The Cup of Ages remains forever from the grasping hands of the covetous, my faithful servant,” the goddess assured him.  “So it is now, and ever so it shall be.  Through the bloodstained hand of innocence, the legacy of Zeranon will be denied the people of Norrath, by privilege of its keeper.”<br>
<br>
The trees above fell into vague shadows, only barely seen by the ranger’s fading vision.  “I wish…” he muttered, his voice failing as well.  “I… wish it… weren’t so.”<br>
<br>
Light, sharp and vivid, pierced through the darkness, flooding his eyes with its radiance.  The shadows of the trees vanished, lost in the purest white that pervaded the ranger’s vision.  The light was divine and comforting.  The light banished the pain of his wounds and that of his body, as it lay broken and bleeding on the ground.  The light masked the gruesome scar marring his face.  <br>
<br>
“I know.”<br>
<br>
The ranger’s eyes closed, a shallow sigh escaping his nostrils.  The only sounds to be heard were the innocent chirpings of nature’s forest.<br>

<br>
Journey to Highpass Hold – HighKeep –  Final Day<br>
<br>
I had a real scare today.  This afternoon while traveling through Kithicor, we were set upon a second time by Kieran Shadowseek.   From listening to Dreketh and her father talk, I gather that somehow the liche breached the threshold barring the Plane of Hate and allowed legions of undead to escape into the woods in broad daylight.  <br>
<br>
As usual, I was all but useless until Dreketh managed to bring me to my senses, and told me to run for help.  It figures, doesn’t it?  Here I am, sworn to protect her with my life, and the best thing I can do is turn my back and get someone who can actually make a difference.<br>
<br>
As you might have guessed, her father showed up to save the day after pulling my sorry skin out of another fire.  Thanks to him, Dreketh and I are now safe.<br>
<br>
But at a terrible cost.<br>
<br>
Ranin Treestalker, the ranger who has been many times our savior in our journey, died today while defending Dreketh from the liche’s horde.  Whatever failings he had as a person, he was a true protector who saved us both on numerous occasions.  I get the feeling he saved us more times than we know or were even aware of.  I don’t know that I can call him my friend, exactly.  But I do owe him my life.  I hope one day I will be able to repay his sacrifice and serve others so selflessly as he did.<br>
<br>
His loss has left me barren in many ways.  Even in death, he refused to tell me why he did what he did.  “I did it for love,” was one of the last things he said to me, claiming that some day I’ll understand what he meant by that.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to the real reason for this entry.  Today heralds the last day Dreketh and I will spend alone together in Norrath.  From now on, her father will take on an active role in protecting us from all harm, which means the liberties we enjoyed in our journeys are about to come to an end.  It sounds crazy (I can’t believe I’m even writing this), but I’m going to miss those days of traveling with Dreketh.  I was scared out of my mind half of the time, and revolted at what I saw the other half.  Traipsing across Norrath without money or even a full square meal that isn’t foraged of nature is a pastime I wouldn’t recommend for most sane people, but it was by far the best thing I think could ever happen to me at this point in my life.<br>
<br>
In the days we spent alone together, I have come to learn so much – not only about Dreketh, but also about life in general.  I just felt like writing them down on paper so I’ll never forget.<br>
<br>
Over the past months, Dreketh has taught me that direct problems require direct solutions, and that trying to solve such problems with finesse is usually fruitless.  She has taught me that first impressions, while lasting, are not always the best impressions to keep.  She taught me that prejudice is ugly on both sides of the coin.  She taught me that anyone could be capable of far more than reasonable expectations – even for themselves.  All it takes is someone who believes in you, or even a skeptic who disbelieves.<br>
<br>
Lastly, she taught me fear.  Not the obvious fear of pain or death.  I mean a whole different kind of fear.  I’m not sure I can properly put this fear into words that could do it justice, or that I should even try.  All I know is that when I found Dreketh lying on the edge of death in the Tunnel of Ro, something hit me more deeply than anything else in this world.  The thought of what she suffered because of me, and that she might die because of it was more frightening than all the undead in existence.  For some reason, the Pact no longer meant anything to me.  Just making sure she lived was all that mattered – Tunare and the Chalice be damned.  <br>
<br>
I would have gladly died myself if it meant her survival.  I’ve never been able to say that about anyone and know it to be the absolute truth.  I’ve never felt so close to someone that I could honestly say I would lay down my life for them until now.  I don’t know how or why, but after everything we’ve been through together, I’ve come to care more about Dreketh than anyone else.  A Dark Elf – a shadow knight of Innoruuk – is my most trusted friend and comrade.<br>
<br>
It is said by Erollisi Marr Herself that only through the precepts of love will the Cup of Ages be unsealed.  Widdlethorp claims it to be a matter of implicit trust, but I think he’s wrong.  Sitting here on my bed in HighKeep writing this, and from the stirrings I’ve felt within me lately, I think I can say that it goes beyond trust or simple friendship.  It’s something more by far.  <br>
<br>
Tunare forgive me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The door to the elegant room closed quietly behind the Dark Elf as she entered carrying a washbasin nestled in her arms.  Her bare feet swept silently across the padded carpeting to set the container carefully on the nightstand next to her bed.  Removing the white towel from over her shoulder, she wiped her hands of a little water that had spilled while she glanced up to her companion across the room.<br>
<br>
Laera rested on her richly adorned bed, sitting upright against the backboard.  One leg was sprawled on the bedspread before her, while the other bent to support a small, leather-bound book in which she wrote.  <br>
<br>
Not a sound could be heard in the luxurious suite high atop the fortress of HighKeep.  The deep red and violet motif covered the floors with thick carpeting and heavy draperies concealing every square inch of wall space.  Past a small sitting room lay a balcony offering a breathtaking view of the Highpass Mountains overlooking the courtyard several hundred feet below.  The room was quite literally fit for kings, as was its original intent, and Xon Quexill had demanded nothing less for the advocates of the Pact during their stay.  <br>
<br>
Dreketh was duly impressed with the decor.  Laera thought the color scheme depressing.<br>
<br>
“You still writing in that book?” asked the shadow knight, tossing the towel down next to the washbasin.<br>
<br>
“Mmm hmm,” Laera replied distractedly.<br>
<br>
Crossing her arms, Dreketh lifted her cloth tunic off over her head.  With both thumbs, she adjusted the straps on her red and black halter-top, sparing several moments to stare hesitantly at her companion.   <br>
<br>
“Can I read it?” she asked in a quiet, deliberately nonchalant voice.<br>
<br>
A small grin graced Laera’s features, her eyes still fixed to the pages.  “I… don’t think you’d appreciate everything I had to say in it over the last few months,” she replied.<br>
<br>
“Probably not,” Dreketh grudgingly agreed, sitting at the edge of her bed, her back to the Wood Elf.  Small droplets of water splashed in the basin as she wet the towel and brought it up to her face to wash the grime away.  “You’re making me wish I’d thought to keep a log.  If nothing else, I’d have something to show you in return.”<br>
<br>
Laera closed her book.  “My headmistress pressured me into it.  She said it would prove valuable to my mission.”<br>
<br>
“Has it?” The Dark Elf smiled crookedly, an amused cynicism coloring her voice.<br>
<br>
“So far it’s only proven valuable in showing how ignorant I can be sometimes.”  Laera sighed, squeezing the book so the pages flipped beneath her thumb.  “I look at some of these pages, and I can’t believe I wrote them only a few weeks ago.”<br>
<br>
Casting the Wood Elf a brief glance, Dreketh reached up to wash her shoulders clean.  <br>
<br>
Laera resignedly tossed the book onto her nightstand and hugged herself with a small shiver as she sat.  “How was your reunion with your father?” she asked curiously.  “I imagine he’s happy to see you safe.”<br>
<br>
“You’d think so,” the Dark Elf replied coolly, continuing her work.<br>
<br>
Laera gave her companion an inquisitive look.  “Oh?  Didn’t it go well?”<br>
<br>
Washing her arms, Dreketh’s brow furrowed as she searched for words.  “That’s the problem, everything went fine.  It was all a little too fine, in a way.”<br>
<br>
“Tunare strike me down if that makes any sense.”  Laera shrugged offhandedly.<br>
<br>
Dreketh rinsed the washcloth, ringing it out tightly as she spoke.  “I don’t know.  Somehow it all seemed so… contrived, I suppose.  It was like Xon was deliberately going out of his way to be happy to see me.  I’ve known him for many years, and I’ve never seen anything but sincerity reflected in his eyes.  Be it pleasure or disappointment, I could always tell where I stood with him.  Today was the first time I’ve ever glimpsed any sign of pretense when he looked at me.”<br>
<br>
“Well…” Laera appeared thoughtful.  “You told me Dark Elves aren’t prone to open displays of affection.  Maybe he was behaving in the best way he could with all these Humans in the keep?”<br>
<br>
“No, you don’t know him like I do.”  Dreketh shook her head, trying in vain to reach the washcloth over her shoulder to clean her back.  “I’ve had him give me his approval in public before, and this is different.  Very different.  I can’t think of what it could be, unless somehow I’ve failed in some way that he doesn’t want to-”<br>
<br>
Unexpectedly, the druid’s hands grabbed hold of the washcloth from behind.  With the same care and attention with which she cleaned the Dark Elf’s wounds in the Commonlands, Laera began to wipe away the cold cinders and sweat from her companion’s blue-skinned back as she sat cross-legged behind her.<br>
<br>
“Maybe it’s me,” the druid said softly.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean,” Dreketh muttered sullenly.  “You weren’t even in earshot.”<br>
<br>
“I mean, maybe it’s you and me,” Laera explained, squeezing the washcloth so tiny rivers of water ran down the Dark Elf’s back.  “When you last saw your father, would you have even considered letting me do this for you?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh half-turned at the druid’s words.  “But… that doesn’t make any sense.  I was all but ordered to stay with you and gain your trust.  He knows that.  Why should that make such a difference?”<br>
<br>
“It seemed to make quite a difference to Kella N’Threk,” Laera said, shrugging.  “He gave you those orders, and he’s the one who had you banished from Neriak for being an ‘Elf lover.’ ”<br>
<br>
Bewildered, Dreketh turned her back once more, pondering the Wood Elf’s point.<br>
<br>
“Let’s face it,” Laera said, resuming her work.  “We’ve both changed.  A lot.  I doubt my own headmistress would even recognize me as one of her own students if she saw me like this right now.  I know she would never approve of half the things I’ve done.  There’s that, and…”  She hesitated<br>
<br>
“And…?”<br>
<br>
“Well,” the Wood Elf continued,  “I saw the look on your father’s face when I healed you.”<br>
<br>
A quiver went through Dreketh’s stomach.  At the time, she had been too involved in dealing with the pain of her injuries to take notice.  But thinking about it, it would certainly have affected Xon to see his daughter being healed by one of Tunare’s followers.  The Wood Elf was right.  Things really had changed – far more drastically than the shadow knight was prepared to admit.  <br>
<br>
Thinking back to her conversation with her father, Dreketh remembered something else she saw in his face.  It was another look she had never seen in him before – an odd sort of melancholy that she at first mistook for fatigue.  At the time, she dismissed the expression in favor of more important issues she needed to discuss with him, given the short amount of time they’d had for their reunion.  In the end, Xon insisted that she and Laera retire to their suite for the evening, saying he had an imperative matter to attend to before the day was out.<br>
<br>
Considering the matter now, it all made sense to the Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
Dreketh shook her head slowly.  “If we’ve changed so much, then why is it I still get nauseous whenever you’re right, Wood Elf?” she asked caustically.<br>
<br>
Laera smiled.  “It’s a gift.” Reaching around to rinse the washcloth in the basin, the back of the druid’s hand brushed against Dreketh’s upper arm.<br>
<br>
“Innoruuk’s bane!” the Dark Elf swore.  “You’re freezing cold!”<br>
<br>
“It’s just the water,” Laera answered glibly.  “And being in this chilly place high in the mountains doesn’t help much, either.”<br>
<br>
“Troll scat, it’s not that cold in here,” Dreketh declared.  Turning to face her companion squarely, the Dark Elf took hold of the druid’s hand that held the washcloth.  Her expression darkening still, she squeezed the toes on each of Laera’s feet in the palms of her hands.  “You didn’t tell me the cold remained after the liche was banished,” she said accusingly.<br>
<br>
“It didn’t,” Laera shrugged.  “It left soon after I ran to get help.  It seemed the farther away I got from the lich, the more it went away.”<br>
<br>
“Your own body temperature masked it when your heart started beating faster,” the Dark Elf explained, pressing two fingers against the Wood Elf’s neck.  “Now that you’re calming down and starting to rest, it’s returning.”<br>
<br>
“What… what does this mean?”  Laera asked, uneasy at her companion’s words.  “That the liche isn’t really defeated?  That he’s still out there somewhere after me?”<br>
<br>
“No…” Dreketh paused a moment, mentally gauging the Wood Elf’s steady, relaxed heartbeat.  “No.  My father assured me the liche was forever gone from Norrath.”<br>
<br>
“Then what is it?”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf’s hand fell to rest limply on the bed, her expression haunted.  “It means it isn’t the liche who is observing you,” she whispered, realizing the truth.  “It never was.”<br>
<br>
“You mean someone else is after me?”  Laera’s disbelief was palpable in her voice.  “Another necromancer?”<br>
<br>
Dreketh nodded slowly, her eyes distracted in thought.<br>
<br>
“Well, who?” the Wood Elf pressed.  “Who is it?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” Dreketh said, shaking her head.  “I don’t even know if there’s a way of finding out.  Such spells in necromancy require the skill of a master – maybe even an archmaster of the dead.  My father would be able to tell us more.”<br>
<br>
“Well, get him up here!  Hurry!” Laera insisted, the anxiety rising in her voice as she felt herself starting to shiver.  Whether it was from the chills or from her own fright, she couldn’t tell.<br>
<br>
“Relax, calm down.”  The shadow knight placed a comforting hand on her companion’s arm.  “He won’t be able to do anything about it until morning anyway, after he’s well rested.  Defeating the liche took a great deal of strength, and he hasn’t slept since leaving Neriak two days ago.”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf looked dubious, suppressing the urge to argue.<br>
<br>
“The chill itself isn’t dangerous,” Dreketh reassured, sensing the druid’s qualms.  “It serves as a warning – that’s all.  It will only get a little worse as you fall asleep, when your heart beats slower.”<br>
<br>
Laera’s green eyes held her gaze, the Wood Elf’s head nodding in a barely visible shudder.  Dreketh opened her mouth to say more, but stopped at seeing the druid’s pleading expression.  Closing her mouth, she released a small sigh through her nose.<br>
<br>
“Please?” Laera whispered.<br>
<br>
Dreketh cast a scathing look at the door to the suite, as if blaming it.  “Okay, we’ll go talk to Xon, but that’s all.  If he says everything will be fine until morning, with that be enough for you?”<br>
<br>
“Okay,” the Wood Elf agreed with a modest smile.<br>
<br>
“Okay, here…” Dreketh grabbed hold of a plush blanket resting at the foot of her bed.  Unfolding it, she wrapped the thick fabric around Laera like a makeshift cloak.  “This will help retain your body heat.  That should ease the cold a little, at least for now.”<br>
<br>
“Thanks.”  Laera grabbed hold of the blanket, clasping it tightly around her neck.<br>
<br>
“Right,” the shadow knight nodded.  Reaching out, she took hold of the Wood Elf’s arm through the blanket, helping her to stand.  “Let’s get this over with.  With any luck, Xon won’t be asleep yet.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The two young companions stole their way down the hall, their feet making less noise than assassin’s leather against the sleek marble floor.  Laera balked at the touch of the cold stone against her bare feet, but decided not to press matters with Dreketh.  Her small victory was hard-won, and she didn’t want to risk the Dark Elf changing her mind about this midnight jaunt to see her father.<br>
<br>
Instead, the Wood Elf wrapped the blanket around herself more tightly, hoping that soon she would be able to feel a difference in temperature as Dreketh promised.  As it was now, she didn’t feel any warmer than before, but at least she wasn’t getting colder beyond her feet.  Laera marveled at how the Dark Elf was clad only in her scant halter-top and bottoms that she typically wore beneath her armor.  The climate seemed far too cold, but she reminded herself that the air inside the keep wasn’t truly as chill as it felt to her.<br>
<br>
Approaching what Laera presumed was Xon Quexill’s room, Dreketh knocked lightly on the wooden door.<br>
<br>
“Master Xon?  Are you awake?” she called in a muted voice.  When no answer came from within, she knocked again, her voice growing somewhat louder.  “Father?  Forgive me, master, but this is important…”<br>
<br>
Still no answer.  <br>
<br>
The sound of footfalls approached from down the hall – the familiar sound of a guard walking his patrol through the keep.  As the tall Human rounded the corner, he saw the two young women lingering outside the chambers of Neriak’s visiting dignitary, and approached.<br>
<br>
“You two lost?” he asked from within his surrounding helm.<br>
<br>
“These are my father’s quarters,” Dreketh explained.<br>
<br>
“And who would that be?” the guard challenged.<br>
<br>
“Xon Quexill, master necromancer from Neriak,” the Dark Elf replied, folding her arms in annoyance at having her word questioned by this Human.  <br>
<br>
The guard looked briefly to Laera, then back to Dreketh.  “The Teir’Dal is currently in conference.”<br>
<br>
“Do you know where?” Dreketh asked.<br>
<br>
“Down the stairs and to the right, in the Summit Room,” the man said, tilting his head casually back down the hallway.  “But that won’t do you any good.  It’s a closed session.  No partisans allowed inside.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight looked to her companion, silently asking if Laera knew about any of this.  The druid shook her head, shrugging slightly.<br>
<br>
“Do you know what the conference is about?  Who is attending?” Dreketh asked the guard.<br>
<br>
“Do I look like the chamberlain?” the man replied irritably.  “The only reason I know he’s there is because his room is on my beat, and it’s my job to pay attention.”  The guard resumed his patrol, muttering under his breath about demanding inkies.<br>
<br>
“He’s holding a meeting?” Dreketh asked of no one in particular.<br>
<br>
“Do you think it’s about the Pact?”  Laera added her own question.<br>
<br>
“Xon is custodian of the Pact now,” the Dark Elf replied.  “I can’t imagine what else it could be about.”<br>
<br>
“Then why weren’t we invited?”  The druid’s demeanor turned sour.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know.”  Dreketh pondered, idly rubbing the back of her neck.  “This is something I’d expect from Kella N’Threk.  But my father?”  The shadow knight shook her head.<br>
<br>
“Maybe it’s something else,” Laera suggested.  “Maybe he’s settling matters with our stay here at the keep?”<br>
<br>
“In a closed session?” Dreketh replied skeptically.  “No, this has something to do with the Pact.  He wouldn’t instruct us to travel all this way to meet him just because of some trivial business he had.”<br>
<br>
Laera looked warily down the hall in the direction the guard indicated.  “Then what is it?”<br>
<br>
“Let’s find out.”  Dreketh started down the hall, her jaw set.<br>
<br>
“How?” persisted the Wood Elf.  “The guards aren’t going to just let us breeze into a closed session with a Neriak diplomat and the-gods-know-what-else.”<br>
<br>
“Then we’ll have to-“ Dreketh stopped dead in her tracks.  Her stunned features slowly melted as a winning smile crept across her face.  “Of course!” she said, lifting a small fist to press against her forehead.<br>
<br>
“What?  What is it?”<br>
<br>
“Come on.  Hurry.” The shadow knight continued walking, her step nearly double what it was before.  “My father does want us in that session, but for some reason can’t have us there in any official capacity.”<br>
<br>
“How do you know?” Laera asked peevishly as the two climbed the cold, stone stairs leading to the luxury suites.<br>
<br>
“I know because he slipped me a few hundred platinum as we spoke,” Dreketh explained.  “He said it was to cover any ‘unforeseen expenses.’  I had no idea what he meant until now.”<br>
<br>
“What did he mean?” <br>
<br>
“I can’t believe I didn’t see this before.”  Dreketh berated herself, opening the door to their quarters.  “There were too many people and guards hovering around for him to tell me what he really wanted to say…”<br>
<br>
“So, what did he want to say!  Tunare’s mercy, I hate it when you do this!” the Wood Elf growled at her cryptic companion.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight stopped midway as she entered the room to turn and whisper at her frustrated companion.  “We’re supposed to bribe the guards.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“…would be within this issue over and over.”  The words of Xon Quexill echoed through the Summit Room, heard clearly by all save for two pairs of pointed ears high above as they crept their way among the empty seats on the balcony.  “The Prophecy of Zeranon spoken by the mouth of Erollisi Marr is upon us, and will be ignored at the peril of those who turn a blind eye.”<br>
<br>
“Bold words for a follower of Innoruuk!” another voice erupted from below.  “Since when does a Teir’Dal necromancer pay heed to the words of the Queen of Love, or any other god besides his conceited Prince of Hate?”<br>
<br>
“Can you see anything?” Dreketh whispered, crawling along the stone floor.<br>
<br>
Laera shook her head from within in the folds of the blanket.  Jutting her chin forward, she silently suggested they inch closer to the railing.<br>
<br>
“It is at the behest of Innoruuk that I am compelled to pay heed for the good of all Neriak and its citizens,” Xon Quexill answered grandly.  “Truth is truth, regardless of its source.  Adherence to the truth is the opiate of the wise.  Ignorance of the truth is the downfall of fools!”<br>
<br>
“Oh, the absurdity at hearing the voice of deception speak of truth!” the other voice returned amidst the collective muttering of those assembled.  “What now?  Are the Teir’Dal to embrace the principles of Mithaniel Marr as well?  What else would you have us believe, necromancer?”<br>
<br>
“I still can’t see anything,” the shadow knight muttered through clenched teeth.<br>
<br>
“I see your father,” Laera replied, craning her neck cautiously.  “There’s a Human standing next to him in a uniform, but he’s not the one arguing with him.”<br>
<br>
“Any other Teir’Dal?”  Dreketh tried to see from the Wood Elf’s angle.<br>
<br>
“Not that I can see.”  The shivering druid risked a closer look.<br>
<br>
“Belief is of no importance,” Xon Quexil replied, his voice calm and ominous as he addressed the unseen dissenter.  “Only actions hold any relevance… or consequence.  Are there any present who deny the profound consequence the Pact holds for both our nations?”  The necromancer’s gaze scanned the room sternly, challenging even one person to dispute his words.  <br>
<br>
None did.  The room remained deathly silent as Xon Quexill slowly resumed his normal stance.<br>
<br>
The uniformed man cleared his throat softly, breaking the tension.  “Pursuant to the petition of Xon Quexill of Neriak, the chair recognizes Yeolarn Bronzeleaf, High Priest of Tunare representing the High Elf city-state of Felwithe.”  <br>
<br>
The Human extended a hand below the view of the balcony where the assemblage sat.   From behind the bottom edge of the railing emerged the light-haired, pale-skinned figure of a High Elf dressed in gleaming silver armor.  <br>
<br>
Laera gasped at the sight of the High Elf, the shadow knight's hand quickly covering the druid’s mouth to silence her.<br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf turned to address the hidden assembly.  “Dutifully wise,” he said, his voice full of strength.  “I come to this place not by the summoning of a Teir’Dal, but in adherence to the calling of my own common sense.  In a short time, war will be unleashed between our peoples…”<br>
<br>
Dreketh raised an eyebrow at the now silent Wood Elf, warning her to be mindful.  Laera nodded slowly and the Dark Elf’s hand was removed.  Together, the two companions crawled behind the railing surrounding the balcony’s edge to gain a better angle.<br>
<br>
“…the cause of which can no longer be denied within the walls of this chamber.  The Pact of Zeranon and possession of his Chalice, the Cup of Ages.”<br>
<br>
The assembly stirred.  Voices muttered amongst themselves at hearing the truth being spoken openly when such things had until then only been spoken in whispers.  Having gained a better view of the floor, the young women witnessed an audience comprised of Elves – a collection of Dark Elves seated to one side with a collection of High Elves and several Wood Elves seated to the other.<br>
<br>
The Human spoke to regain order.  “Is it then to be assumed that King Tearis Thex of Felwithe is willing to negotiate a peace treaty that will dissolve both armies for the good of the lands of Norrath?”<br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf turned to address the speaker.  “I have come to HighKeep to speak on behalf of the king by voicing it thusly…”  He spared a moment to turn a critical eye toward the master necromancer.  “There will be no dissolution of Tunare’s army!”<br>
<br>
Bedlam broke out in the Summit Room as Dark Elves stood to voice their dissent, shouting cries accusing the forces of light of deliberating genocide upon the Teir’Dal.  The High Elves and Wood Elves responded in kind, blaming Neriak for posturing first by forming a secret alliance with the Crushbone orcs on Faydwer.<br>
<br>
Through the noise and confusion, Dreketh glanced at her father.  Xon Quexill’s reaction was surprisingly mild.  The master necromancer merely stood there motionless, a knowing grin twisting his lips slightly as if sharing a private joke with himself.  With chaos filling the room, she doubted anyone but she saw it amidst all the distraction.<br>
<br>
The uniformed Human shouted over the clamor, demanding order.  His insistence was lost on the irrepressible crowd of Elves all shouting at once.  It appeared as though the negotiations were about to break into outright hostility until Xon Quexill’s commanding voice rang out over the ruckus.<br>
<br>
“Dissolution is not the purpose for which I have petitioned you all here!” he declared.  Yeolarn Bronzeleaf folded his armored arms, casting the Dark Elf a glowering look as he listened.  “On the contrary, the massing of armies and the threat of violence serve ideally to conceal the true nature of what I am about to propose.”<br>
<br>
Several dissenting voices rose from behind Tunare’s high priest until he raised his hand, demanding silence from his entourage.  Together, High Elf and Dark Elf matched each other’s gaze.<br>
<br>
“Make your point.”  Yeolarn Bronzeleaf spoke with equanimity, his hand still raised.<br>
<br>
The necromancer’s hands disappeared into the sleeves of his crimson robes as he paced the floor.  “The massing of armies to sequester possession of Zeranon’s Chalice is a pointless endeavor, for only the forces of Hate know its whereabouts.  Once the Chalice’s location is revealed to your advocate, the amassed army of light will set sail across the Ocean of Tears and march on Neriak, is that not so?”<br>
<br>
The High Elf’s hand lowered slowly.  His eyes followed the Teir’Dal’s every move, but offered no answer.<br>
<br>
“Both factions know of the futility of waging war for the possession of the Chalice,” Quexill continued.  “An army thousands strong could never traverse enough landscape to arrive before the Teir’Dal have staked our claim.  Contest?”<br>
<br>
All eyes turned to Yeolarn Bronzeleaf's iron features.<br>
<br>
“No contest,” the high priest admitted, his bearing cautious.  The assemblage stirred.<br>
<br>
The necromancer nodded.  “This being so,” he held up one finger, reminding Dreketh strongly of the gesture Xavier used when lecturing a classroom filled with students, “the Army of Light has but one and only one solution left to them, and a singular reason for massing to begin with… Destruction of the Teir’Dal and the city of Neriak before the Prince of Hate is able to take possession of the Chalice.”<br>
<br>
Whispered mutterings erupted from the Dark Elves assembled while Yeolarn Bronzeleaf continued to watch the necromancer with silent wariness, his expression betraying neither confirmation nor denial.<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill spread his arms wide.  “Only a fool will dispute the ability of Tunare’s massing army in achieving this goal,” the necromancer admitted, his hateful grin twisted with irony.  “Even with the assistance of our Ogre allies of Oggok and the Trolls of Grobb anchoring our forces, the fate of Neriak is spelled as doom in Teir’Dal blood.”<br>
<br>
More whispered voices came from those assembled in the Summit Room.  Even the Human guards standing watch at the entrance turned to look at one another.  For the leader of an army to make such an open statement was brazen – even reckless – in the face of an enemy during such negotiations.  Xon Quexill had as much as admitted defeat before the high priest of Tunare for all to hear.<br>
<br>
“Nevertheless, Innoruuk will still be in possession of Zeranon’s prize,” the necromancer qualified his words.  “My predecessor, Kella N’Threk has seen to that.  Though Tunare's victory may be gained on Norrath, the war of conquest in the heavens will be a definitive one.  With the Cup of Ages in His divine hands, Innoruuk will trounce a your goddess and all other deities who stand against Him.”<br>
<br>
“Dear Goddess,” Laera whispered, drawing the blanket around her tightly.  Dreketh turned a melancholy glance to the dismayed druid briefly, her attention going once again to the floor below as her father resumed his address.<br>
<br>
“I have called you here to offer another alternative for our people, our gods, and for all of Norrath,” he said quietly.<br>
<br>
“Why?” asked Yeolarn Bronzeleaf, his voice even and undisturbed by the necromancer’s grand statement.<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill returned the high priest’s stare with equal calm.  “Because our Father is a selfish and fickle parent,” he said.  “In His ambitions, He would forsake His children and all who answer His call to their fate for the chance at gaining ascendancy over all other gods.  I do not wish to see my people defeated and scattered to the winds by the army of your goddess.  I do not wish to see our home crushed under Her heel a glimpse before she Herself falls to the same fate.  In short, the idea of the Prince of Hate obtaining the Cup of Ages is as terrifying to me as it is to you.<br>
<br>
“Regardless of what happens now, our two peoples are forever doomed, should the gods have their way.”  Xon Quexill’s arms spread wide, the folds of his robes falling about his arms to drape loosely in the still air.<br>
<br>
The high priest of Tunare stood motionless, still offering no hint of his inner thoughts as he listened.  The assemblage remained so silent, the two hidden companions feared the beating of their own hearts would give away their presence.<br>
<br>
“I have called you here to offer another option,” the necromancer said, appealing to Tunare’s priest.  “An option of possible victory for your people… or perhaps mine.  Either way, it will bring us from the brink of mutually assured destruction with which the Pact of Zeranon presents us.”<br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf folded his arms once again, his marble features remaining cold and expressionless.  “And what alternative solution do you present for our consideration, necromancer of Innoruuk?”  The High Elf’s eyebrow rose, indicating that he still had not forgotten that subtle fact.<br>
<br>
“I submit to you, the prophecy of Erollisi Marr, Queen of Love.  I present to you its true meaning, and why I believe neither of our gods are destined to possess the Cup of Ages.”  Xon Quexill’s eyes darted among those assembled, taking note of the quizzical looks that marked the many faces around him.  Advancing toward the high priest standing nearby, the necromancer raised an inviting hand.  “If you would indulge me, High Elf, and quote the prophecy as stated by the lips of the goddess?”<br>
<br>
The High Elf’s eyes narrowed briefly before he spoke.  “The tears of the slayer upon the brow of the slain shall herald the unsealing of the Cup of Ages…”<br>
<br>
“Tears of the slayer!” Quexill interrupted.  “Upon the brow of the slain… Not, I think, an indication of war between blood enemies.  Not, I think, an opiate either of our races would choose to indulge in if the other were wiped from the face of Norrath.”  Having made this point, the necromancer made another gesture, inviting the high priest to continue.<br>
<br>
“Sundered light and shadow will be cast upon mortal soil, wielded in the hand of innocence…”<br>
<br>
“Mortal soil!” Quexill interrupted again.  “Not soil of the heavens!  Sundered light and shadow wielded in the hand of innocence.  Not by the hand of any god.”<br>
<br>
“And the whispered convergence of power will reign unleashed upon all lands of Norrath by privilege of its keeper.”<br>
<br>
Once again, all eyes turned to the custodian of the Pact.  Xon Quexill’s hands disappeared in the sleeves of his robes as he returned to his pacing.<br>
<br>
“Sundered light and shadow.  Whispered convergence of power,” the necromancer mused, his step growing slower.  When he spoke, his voice remained muted and ominous.  “I submit to you, priest of Tunare, honored delegates… that the Cup of Ages still holds the blood of the defeated gods.”<br>
<br>
A collective gasp spread across the room.<br>
<br>
“Furthermore,” Quexill continued speaking slowly and concisely, “I submit to you that the power of those defeated gods – the whispered convergence of power from sundered light and shadow – is to be wielded by the hand of one of the advocates.”<br>
<br>
Another gasp escaped the mouths of the assemblage – some pronouncing their revelation, others marked in skepticism, and still others in pure disbelief.  Ignoring the voices of his delegates, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf stood motionless, returning the necromancer’s gaze as both High Elf and Dark Elf waited for the tumult to dissipate.<br>
<br>
The high priest opened his mouth to ask his question.  “Which advocate?” he asked, already knowing the answer.<br>
<br>
“Simple,” Xon Quexill shrugged, bowing slightly from the waist.  “The one who survives to shed her tears upon the brow of the other.”<br>
<br>
More voices erupted from below, and Dreketh’s vision dimmed at hearing her father’s words.<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe this.  This is impossible, I-,” the shadow knight muttered, stopping to look at her companion.<br>
<br>
Laera had retreated into the folds of her blanket, shivering uncontrollably from her chill.  “No…no, it can’t be” she whispered tremulously.  Looking up from within her makeshift cowl, the Wood Elf spoke to Dreketh directly.  “I won’t fight you, Dreketh.  I won’t!  Even if I did, I could never kill you, and that… that can only mean…”  Laera’s eyes started filling with tears as her trembling grew worse.<br>
<br>
Reaching over, the Dark Elf tried to calm the dismayed druid.  “Come on,” she said.  Taking hold of Laera’s arm gently, she guided them both toward the nearest exit.  “Let’s get you back to the room.  I’ve heard all I care to hear.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“We have to leave, Dreketh!” Laera insisted for the fifth time since leaving the Summit Room.  The trembling Wood Elf remained adamant about them turning their back on the Pact and escaping while their respective superiors were in conference.<br>
<br>
Dreketh stopped before the door to their room.  “Keep it down,” she warned under her breath, looking down the hall both ways to see if any guards were about.  “We can’t just leave.  Xon’s the custodian of the Pact now.  He’d know exactly where we went and what we were doing.  He knows every move we make.  How else do you think he knew to send the note to Crushbone?”<br>
<br>
“We can’t just stay,” Laera argued, following Dreketh inside.  “If we stay, they’ll make us unseal the vault.  One way or another, the Cup of Ages will be returned to the world and one of us will be-”<br>
<br>
“I’m not deaf!” Dreketh whirled on her companion angrily.  “I was there!  I heard the same thing you did!  You don’t need to keep explaining to me!”<br>
<br>
“I’m… I’m sorry,” apologized Laera.  Holding the blanket by one hand, she sank back into the cowl.<br>
<br>
“And stop cowering from me!”  The shadow knight continued to berate the Wood Elf.  “You should know by now I’m not going to hurt you!”<br>
<br>
“I’m not cowering, damn it!”  Something in Laera snapped.  Casting off the blanket, the agitated druid threw it angrily against the curtained wall to land on the carpet.  “I’m freezing my butt off over here!  You said it wouldn’t get any worse, and now it feels like it’s twenty degrees colder!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh’s jaw dropped as she saw the Wood Elf’s arms and legs riddled in goose bumps all over, pale as if the druid had been playing in the snow without any protection from the cold.  Her normally pristine, tan skin shown marred by pinkish blue veins marring her hands and feet.  <br>
<br>
Laera stood trembling before the astonished Dark Elf.  Dreketh couldn’t believe her eyes.  Reaching out, she touched the druid’s fingers.  It felt as if she were holding an ice cube in her hands.<br>
<br>
“By all the gods,” she whispered.<br>
<br>
“What’s happening to me, Dreketh?” Laera asked beseechingly, her anxious brow furrowed with worry as her eyes held the shadow knight’s gaze.<br>
<br>
Fear and concern marked the Dark Elf’s expression.  “I… can’t say for sure,” she whispered in awe.  “I’ve never seen chills this bad before.”<br>
<br>
“What are we going to do?” the Wood Elf asked, her chin starting to quake slightly.<br>
<br>
A moment of indecision passed before all sign of Dreketh’s apprehension was replaced by firm resolve.  “Come on,” she said.  Still holding the druid's icy hand, the Dark Elf led her to the edge of her bed and drew down the covers.  “Xon won’t be available until morning.  We’ll talk to him then.”<br>
<br>
Climbing into bed, Laera slid her legs between the silken sheets, looking up at the Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
“We’ll talk to him about everything,” Dreketh said pointedly at the Wood Elf’s questioning gaze.<br>
<br>
Laera nodded shakily, turning over to face the wall as she pulled the covers up over her shoulder.  Seeing the druid still shivering, Dreketh stepped over to where Laera’s discarded blanket lay on the floor.  Picking it up, she spread it atop her companion, adding it to the Wood Elf’s arsenal against the chill.<br>
<br>
Lying on her side, clutching the elongated pillow to her chest, Laera thanked the Dark Elf for the blanket.  At receiving a customary grunt of acknowledgement, she closed her eyes and listened to the Dark Elf’s footsteps as Dreketh blew out each of the lamps lighting the room.  Darkness fell, and it wasn’t long before the sound of the covers on Dreketh’s bed being drawn reached the Wood Elf’s ears.<br>
<br>
Images raced through the Laera’s mind in a whirlwind of disjointed thoughts.  All that she witnessed in the Summit Room haunted her as the memory of all those important people casually discussed their fate entered her mind.  Laera remembered the feeling she got in the Temple of Tunare in Felwithe when Yeolarn Bronzeleaf sized her up as if she were a prize animal at the fair.  The same feeling hit her hard as she saw events unfold in the conference room.  She also remembered small Widdlethorp’s words.  “You’re the pawns of authority, and the play things of your gods.”<br>
<br>
That thought alone was as chilling as the air.  Try as she might, Laera couldn’t suppress the chattering of her teeth.  Worried that she might disturb Dreketh, she clenched her jaw, silently willing it to still.<br>
<br>
Too late, she heard the Dark Elf’s bedcovers rustling across the room.  She knew she was in for a rebuke as the sound of Dreketh’s feet chafing across the carpet drew close.<br>
<br>
Just as she braced herself to receive the shadow knight’s irritated words, she felt her own bedcovers lift and the mattress behind her sink.  Confused, Laera was about to turn over to see what Dreketh was up to when an arm wrapped itself around her, covering hers in a warm embrace from behind.  Without a word, the Dark Elf snuggled up against Laera’s back, her natural body heat warming every part of the Wood Elf that she touched.  In time, the small druid’s trembling slowed to nothing more than an occasional shiver now and then, as the temperature began to rise comfortably beneath the covers.<br>
<br>
Laera lay solidly still, deathly afraid that if she stirred too much, Dreketh may change her mind and return to her own bed.  Placing her hand over the Dark Elf’s, she laced her fingers between those of her companion, and clutched the dark blue hand to her chest.<br>
<br>
“You’re not going to kill me…” The druid whispered.  “Are you?”<br>
<br>
“Go to sleep, Laera.”<br>
<br>

<br>
<c "#FFff00">Chapter 25 - Departure</c><br>
<br>
Dreketh blinked, the light from the lantern across the room interrupting her quiet sleep.  Suppressing the need to stretch, fearful of waking her Wood Elf companion nestled comfortably in her arms, she instead yawned and rubbed her eyes to clear them of their sleep.<br>
<br>
Laera lay motionless, save for her slow, rhythmic breaths.  Though the druid’s skin remained chill for having stayed underneath three separate blankets during the course of the night, at least her skin wasn’t ice-cold as it had been the previous evening.<br>
<br>
Shaking her head to herself silently, Dreketh boggled at the chills that so vexed her companion.  Never had she seen or even heard of such extremes in anyone being observed in this manner.  Nevertheless, the Wood Elf did seem somewhat better for the shadow knight’s efforts in keeping her warm during the night, so there was little cause for alarm.  All it would take is to seek out her observer and kill him, whoever that may be.<br>
<br>
Risking another yawn, Dreketh shaded her eyes from the annoying lantern when it suddenly dawned on her that she had blown out all the lit flames in their quarters before going to bed.  Squinting in the light, her bleary eyes caught sight of a robed figure standing calmly near the door.  Alarmed at this intruder, she raised her head.<br>
<br>
“Who goes there?” she demanded in a threatening tone.<br>
<br>
The silhouette made no reply.<br>
<br>
“I said, who-“<br>
<br>
“Relax, daughter.” Dreketh recognized the muted voice of Xon Quexill.  “None but I could enter this room.  I have seen to that.”<br>
<br>
“Master Xon,” she gasped, partially in relief and partially in embarrassment.  “My apologies, father, I-… What are you doing here?"<br>
<br>
Without comment, the shadowy necromancer stepped quietly across the carpeted floor to sit on the mattress next to his daughter and her slumbering companion.  Seeing her father's expression, Dreketh cast a timid glance at the back of the Wood Elf in bed next to her.<br>
<br>
Swallowing, eyes downcast, she whispered her explanation.  "It's not what it looks like."<br>
<br>
Quexill's piercing gaze gleamed in the wavering lantern light, his manner serious, but offering no rebuke or comment on his daughter's words.<br>
<br>
Dreketh's eyes raised to meet her father's.  "We need to talk."<br>
<br>
"Yes… we do."  Master Quexill nodded slowly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The brisk morning air of the HighKeep courtyard assailed Dreketh's senses with the lingering tang of a light rain that had fallen during the night.  Small puddles of water pockmarked the ground and surrounding walls.  The only sounds were those of the night watch being relieved as the aura hovering over the eastern horizon threatened to blossom until full dawn.  At her side as she sauntered her leisurely pace was her father and beloved mentor, Xon Quexill.<br>
<br>
Not knowing quite what to say, Dreketh fell into her initiate mode – speaking only when spoken to, and answering only those questions she was asked.  If only Xon would say something to break the awkward silence, she would have gladly answered any inquiry he might have posed.<br>
<br>
Instead, Quexill continued his measured pace in silence.  Perhaps he, too, was at a loss for words.<br>
<br>
"Laera is being observed," she heard her voice say, breaking the calm like a thunderclap.<br>
<br>
Still, Quexill made no comment.<br>
<br>
"She has been observed since Kithicor," she continued. <br>
<br>
Quexill lifted his face to peer up at the balcony gracing the suite in which the two young women were berthed, the Wood Elf no doubt still sleeping inside.  Breathing deeply, the necromancer took in a healthy portion of the crisp air, but still offered no comment.<br>
<br>
"At first we thought it was the liche who was after her, but it appears we were mistaken," Dreketh pressed on, seeing no need to return to the lingering silence now that she had spoken.  "The chills are severe enough to reveal blood flow beneath her hands and feet – the sign of a master.  You wouldn’t happen to know anything about-"<br>
<br>
"No," Quexill interrupted cryptically.<br>
<br>
Blinking at her father's abruptness, Dreketh licked her dry lips before she spoke.  "Can you intercede?"<br>
<br>
"I will do what I can," the master necromancer replied, his gaze lowering.<br>
<br>
"Thank you," Dreketh whispered.<br>
<br>
"Even though it will be all for naught."<br>
<br>
The shadow knight's skin crawled, knowing her father's meaning.  "So I hear," she commented, alluding to her eavesdropping on the closed session the night before with the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
Father and daughter walked several paces before the necromancer spoke again, his voice direct, but not without a certain degree of charity as he addressed his former student.<br>
<br>
"You will have to kill her, you realize."<br>
<br>
"I know," Dreketh answered, her voice barely audible in the stillness.<br>
<br>
For the first time since their reunion, Quexill looked to his daughter with an expression not entirely distant and callous.  Noting the mark of restraint across her face, the necromancer looked away, trying to suppress his feelings over the source of that restraint.<br>
<br>
"How have you fared in the company of our blood enemy?" he asked, his voice carefully monotone.<br>
<br>
Dreketh's lips pressed together, her answer carefully considered.  "We have overcome all obstacles in our path, master.  The Wood Elf has proven valuable multiple times, both in combat and out.  She even…" the shadow knight hesitated.  "She saved my life, master.  She nurtured me back to health for weeks when I would have perished, otherwise.  I owe her my life, and the continued chance to serve Innoruuk."<br>
<br>
"You owe her nothing, child," her father corrected.  "In preserving your life, she honored her oath to the Pact, nothing more."<br>
<br>
"I believe…"  Once again, Dreketh hesitated, checking her words.  "I believe she would have saved me regardless."<br>
<br>
Quexill nodded, understanding all that she said, and all that she hadn't.  Knowing fully well that Dreketh was not about volunteer anything more unless specifically asked, he decided the time for tact was at an end, in favor of candor.<br>
<br>
"Do you love her?" he asked without a hint of quiver in his voice.<br>
<br>
The question washed over Dreketh the same way it did when asked by a prominent ambassador.  Only this time, it meant so much more – as did her answer.<br>
<br>
"Yes," she responded, a tear running down her blue cheek.<br>
<br>
This was the blasphemy she knew her father was loath to hear, and yet must hear in order to fulfill the Pact.  Only through the precepts of love would the Cup of Ages be unsealed.  Implicit love that prevailed over all other considerations of self-preservation.  Love between a true worshipper of Innoruuk and a sincere devotee of Tunare.<br>
<br>
Her father’s unspoken feelings cut deeply into her soul.  Dreketh suppressed a sob that threatened to escape her throat as her steps were brought short by the firm grasp of Quexill’s hand on her arm.  Turning away, her face twisted with the pain of confessing her sin to the man who meant the most to her in this life, she hid herself from his eyes in shame and disgrace.  The haunting words of persecution shouted in her fevered ears -- Elf lover!  Elf lover!  Elf lover!<br>
<br>
For all her efforts at retaining composure, the sob was released as she felt her father take her by the arms and hold her before him, like a parent demanding the attention of their disobedient child.  Raising her hands, she covered her face.<br>
<br>
"Look at me, Dreketh," he demanded.  "Look at me!"<br>
<br>
Quivering in the master necromancer's grip, the taciturn shadow knight slowly lowered her hands to peer with tear-filled eyes into the face of her master.  Though his features shown blurred in her vision, she could see the stalwart features of her father as he held her gaze with his own.<br>
<br>
"Listen to me very carefully, and accept my words as the absolute truth," Quexill said, his voice calm.  "You have undertaken the most profane and heinous task our Father could require of any of us.  Your grievous sacrifice of hate for love is beyond sacrilege in order to serve His divine will – a demand wholly unwarranted of claim by any partisan of hate."<br>
<br>
Dreketh's chest heaved at her father's words, her face turning once again away.<br>
<br>
"But hear me, child, and believe my words when I say it was truly necessary!" the master necromancer insisted, holding tighter to his daughter, lest she break and run.  "You carry the lives and future of all Teir'Dal upon your shoulders, and your sacrifice will serve to ensure the survival of our people.  If you trust in nothing I have ever told you in your life, you must trust in this!"<br>
<br>
Forlorn, Dreketh ceased in her futile struggle, to rest limply in her father's hands.  She longed to fall on her knees and beg his forgiveness for betraying him and all he had taught her, but Quexill's grasp was unrelenting.<br>
<br>
"Would that I could have spared you this fate, daughter," he continued.  "Alas, I am unable to thwart this much of Kella N'Threk's legacy.  And in this, I regret that I have failed in my duty as your surrogate father and guardian."<br>
<br>
Dreketh's eyes raised in disbelief at what she was hearing.  Here she was, the heretic Elf lover scorned and exiled by her own people, and yet here was her own teacher and mentor apologizing to her in earnest!<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry, my child." Quexill whispered, his own face marked with self-recrimination.  "I'm so sorry I was unable to shelter you of this."<br>
<br>
Looking from one eye to the other, Dreketh raised her hand to caress her father's cheek.  "Please don't do this, Master Xon," she whispered solemnly.  "You were not the one who made the selection.  N'Threk told me as much."  Quexill's eyes closed as he shook his head, denying the relevance of this claim she made.  Placing her hands on her father's chest, she grasped at his robes to emphasize every word she spoke.  "This is not your fault, father.  If anything it's mine!  I was selected because of my shortcomings, because my soul is impure!  I was selected because I had it in my heart to-…"<br>
<br>
Though the ardent look in Dreketh's eyes remained poised on her father's, her throat constricted of its own accord as if unwilling to speak such heresy, even about herself.  Quexill released one hand on his daughter's arm to wipe away her drying tears.<br>
<br>
"Come what may, child, always remember this.  You are a true servant of Innoruuk."  Before Dreketh could argue, he held up a forstalling hand.  "You are a true servant of the Prince, in a way few others can claim.  In answering His call, you have forsaken yourself and your values to serve Him.  That was N'Threk's one true intent as custodian of the Pact.  It was never anything else."<br>
<br>
Dreketh's grasp on her father's robes loosened, her hands to rest gently against his chest as she listened.<br>
<br>
"Now he is past, his task now fallen to me," Quexull continued.  "And serve Innoruuk you shall.  Only now, I will make certain your actions serve our people as well.  My promise to you."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Laera woke to the sound of words she couldn't understand being muttered above her as she lay prone in her bed.  The words sounded harsh and brutal as they were spoken by the assertive, masculine voice, reminding the Wood Elf strongly of Dreketh whenever she spoke in…<br>
<br>
Teir'Dal!<br>
<br>
Immediately, Laera's eyes opened wide to find the blue face of a Dark Elf male dressed in robes chanting over her.  Her comprehension mulled by having been yanked from a fitful sleep, the Wood Elf shrieked in a panic.  Scrambling her legs beneath the tangling covers, she struggled to back away against the headboard when she felt Dreketh's touch on her arms.<br>
<br>
"Laera, relax!" her companion's voice spoke urgently.  "It's all right!  It's my father!  He's removing the chills!"<br>
<br>
Turning, Laera recognized Dreketh at last, and ceased her frantic struggles to get away.  Hesitantly, she looked back at Master Quexill lost in his spell-casting as he stood above her bed.  The necromancer's chanting had died to a dull mumbling, as he worked his power.  Seeing this, she cast a doubtful look at her companion next to her.<br>
<br>
"Really, it's okay," the shadow knight reassured.  "In a few seconds, the observance will be severed, and the chills will leave.  Trust me, my father is the best at what he does."<br>
<br>
Nodding nervously, Laera sought comfort in her companion's confidence.  Glancing askance to Dreketh, Laera leaned over to speak in low tones .  "You could have at least woke me up before he started," she muttered accusingly.<br>
<br>
"With chills this intense, we were concerned about what we were up against," Dreketh explained.  "These are very powerful and complex magics.  It's easier to begin while the subject sleeps."<br>
<br>
"So, what's he doing?"<br>
<br>
"Merely exploratory right now.  Master Xon is attempting to figure out the nature of the observance being placed on you, kind of like sorting through a mess of ropes to find the opposite end of the one you're looking for without tangling it up even more.  Don't worry, though, it's painless and should be over in moments."<br>
<br>
Laera looked back up at Xon Quexill as he continued muttering his arcane words.  Having had it just explained to her, she could almost feel the subtle probing of the necromancer's spells as they wove around her.  At first, she thought it a trick of the mind, but as the seconds wore on, she distinctly felt the faint caress of something flowing about her arms, legs and torso beneath the covers.  The sensation wasn't unpleasant.  Quite the opposite, the young Wood Elf became surprised to discover a wary fondness for the experience.<br>
<br>
As promised, the spell came to an end and Quexill opened his eyes, allowing his hands to fall.  Contrary to his protégé's assurances, however, the master necromancer's expression shown distorted in a mild frustration that disconcerted both druid and shadow knight alike.<br>
<br>
"What's wrong, master?" Dreketh asked.<br>
<br>
Gnawing the inner part of his lower lip, Quexill shook his head.  "I cannot break the observance," he declared with bitter dissatisfaction.<br>
<br>
Blinking at Dreketh questioningly, Laera looked between the necromancer and her companion, wondering what this meant.  The shadow knight calmed her with a touch as she addressed her father.<br>
<br>
"Are you sure?" she asked.  At her master's dire look, she qualified her impertinence.  "It's just that I've never known you to find any web of the dead you couldn't unravel.  Has this happened before?"<br>
<br>
"Not since I became master of the guild," came Quexill's concerned reply, his hand stroking his chin in disturbed thought as he pondered over the timid Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
"W-what does that mean?" Laera asked, hesitant.<br>
<br>
"It means we can't break the spell being cast on you until the moment of inception," Dreketh explained.  "Whoever is observing you must complete the spell before anything can be done to stop it."<br>
<br>
"That may be easier said than done," Quexill commented, his manner still ponderous.  "I don't know the nature of the spell itself, but I can say with some confidence that it is one of the Prime Cants of necromancy."<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked up at her father in disbelief.<br>
<br>
"Prime Cants?" Laera asked innocently.<br>
<br>
"In theory," Quexill explained, "Only I should have knowledge or the authority to cast such a spell in all of Neriak.  Obviously, I am not, which suggests an outside influence."<br>
<br>
"Bertoxxulous, then?" Dreketh suggested.  "Or Cazic-Thule, maybe?  We've had dealings with the god of Fear before."<br>
<br>
"Bertoxxulous has already played his trump with that fool Kieran Shadowseek."  Quexill dismissed the suggestion with a toss of his hand.  "I've seen to it that His minion's influence on this world is permanently at an end.  As for Cazic-Thule or any of the gods whose worshippers meddle in necromancy, there is no way of knowing.  What's worse, is the longer the observance is allowed to continue, the more potent the end result will be."<br>
<br>
"What are we to do, then?" Dreketh asked.<br>
<br>
"For now, I have cloaked the chills from her body.  Though she is still being observed, the effects will be considerably less dramatic than you witnessed last night.  I can make further attempts in the future, but in the meantime there is nothing to be done but keep a watchful eye on your companion and fulfill your oath to protect her when the need arises."<br>
<br>
The necromancer turned to address Laera.<br>
<br>
"Remain bundled, especially at night," he advised the Wood Elf.  "Stay vigilant of any change.  If the chills return, notify me without delay."<br>
<br>
Laera nodded.<br>
<br>
"I must take my leave now," Quexill continued, turning back to Dreketh.  "There is still much to be done before we embark on our journey.  Be ready to depart this place at noon, and prepare yourselves for inclement weather.  For sake of the Wood Elf's condition, doubly so for her."<br>
<br>
Acknowledging the shadow knight's nod with one of his own, the master necromancer began heading for the door.<br>
<br>
"We're leaving?" the Laera piped in.  "Where are we going?"<br>
<br>
Pausing in his stride, Quexill answered the druid's question without turning around.  "To claim your prize, my dear.  For the next seven days you will be surrounded by the most eminently skillful journeymen of both Neriak and Felwithe as we jointly escort you and your companion to the vault of Erollisi Marr."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All too soon, the sun rose to its apex in the sky, heralding the arrival of noonday.  Assembled in the courtyard like an army preparing to march their victory on an intractable foe was the body of soldiers and footmen summoned to protect the advocates of Zeranon's Pact.<br>
<br>
Laera looked out upon the courtyard from their balcony, her meager travelling pack slung over her shoulder.  The young druid couldn't believe the numbers massed to accompany them in their journey.  Though nowhere near approaching the numbers of the army they'd seen in Lesser Faydark, the sea of soldiers stood shoulder to shoulder.  It filled the courtyard to capacity as the pale-skinned High Elves clustered on the east side, while the blue-skinned Teir'Dal assembled on the west in equal numbers -- neither group looking particularly happy about this arrangement.<br>
<br>
In the center stood a number of steeds, harnessed and equipped full with tack for the trip.<br>
<br>
Horses, among most beasts of burden, were a rarity in Norrath -- barely seen at all among the lands populating the known continents.  As such, they were highly coveted by their owners, typically reserved for the highest nobility, if not full royalty, for use in matters of extreme import.  Not even the League of Antonican Bards used such extravagance in delivering their parcels all over Norrath.  Laera could only guess they belonged to Yeolarn Bronzeleaf and his entourage.<br>
<br>
Dreketh emerged from the doorway.<br>
<br>
"You ready?" she asked, her own pack slung over her shoulder in a fashion similar to the druid's.<br>
<br>
Laera nodded absently, her eyes still glued to the scene below.  Stepping forward, Dreketh followed the Wood Elf's gaze to rest down at the spectacle of Elves awaiting their arrival.<br>
<br>
"Scared?" she asked casually.<br>
<br>
Again, the Wood Elf nodded.<br>
<br>
"Me too."<br>
<br>
In silence, the young advocates shared the final moments they would have alone with each other.  Once delivered into the hands of the teeming masses they witnessed below, there was no practical way they would ever be allowed out of the watchful eyes of their chaperones.  Too much depended on them and their safety, at this point.  Beyond the walls of HighKeep lay the outside world, undoubtedly poised and ready to cease this insanity set forth by the Goddess of Life and the Prince of Hate as they made their final stab at fulfilling the prophecy of Erollisi Marr.<br>
<br>
Laera never felt more vulnerable.  She would have given up anything, even personal soldiers measuring well into the hundreds, if she could once again have the watchful eyes of Ranin Treestalker protecting her from amongst the trees.<br>
<br>
"Having any second thoughts?" the shadow knight's voice intruded once again.<br>
<br>
"No," Laera replied.  Tearing herself away from her musings, she turned to face her companion.  "My life is in your hands now, my friend.  I think… maybe it was always meant to be."<br>
<br>
Dreketh's clear, azure eyes bore into the Wood Elf.  At one time, those eyes delivered nothing but loathing and contempt for the druid and her paltry winsome ways.  At one time, Laera could imagine nothing but falling to the Dark Elf's blade, the gaze of those eyes the last thing she ever saw in this life.  But now Laera knew what lurked behind those eyes.  She saw past them into the soul of her companion.  She trusted this Dark Elf standing before her like nothing she'd trusted before, and knew this one shadow knight among shadow knights was worthy of it.<br>
<br>
She would not betray her.  Not Dreketh.<br>
<br>
Accompanied by their individual protectors -- Head Mistress Netheel at Laera's side, and Xon Quexill at Dreketh's -- the advocates of the Pact stepped from the gaping entryway out into the glaring sunlight of the courtyard.  Sergeants from both detachments of Elves barked their orders, and soldiers on both sides snapped to attention in unison.  Ceremoniously, the advocates made their way down the steps and across the gravel.  With assistance from their protectors, they silently mounted their steeds.<br>
<br>
More orders were barked as the soldiers turned, again in unison, and marched out of the courtyard, through the Keep's gates, and into the world of Norrath, escorting the advocates to their destiny.<br>
<br>

<c "#FFff00">Chapter 26 - Devine Justice</c><br>
<br>
Laera Nellynwae sat atop her horse, staring off into space as she rode amidst the odd collection of Elves assembled to protect her.  Thoughts passed through her mind like quicksilver, each being offhandedly inspected and tossed aside by her uncaring psyche.  It didn't matter if the thought was about times past, or her present situation -- the young druid dismissed each in turn as it cropped up.  Even her future seemed vague to the point that it no longer mattered.  She found it ironic how when she first began her journey from Kelethin so many months ago, everything in the world seemed so important to her, and her place in it.  Now, after all that had happened leading up to this final journey in the Pact, nothing seemed important anymore.  Life simply was as it was, and one small Wood Elf could do little to change it.  It was all she could do just to keep up with the tide, much less change its direction.<br>
<br>
At least, that was how it had been so far.  Things were about to change, the druid thought to herself grimly.<br>
<br>
As they journeyed westward, the soldiers took up position along the flanks, vanguard, and rear of their clustered band.  It was an impressive sight, and one Laera was looking forward to savoring once they reached the dreaded Plains of Karana.  Memories of their last reception in those lands brought a crooked smile to the druid's face as she imagined that angry mob attempting to apprehend her and Dreketh now, surrounded as they were by soldiers and bodyguards.<br>
<br>
Having Head Mistress Netheel as her own designated bodyguard was an odd twist of events for the young druid.   With her former tutor constantly at arm's reach, it brought back stark memories of the way things were in Kelethin just before she departed.  She welcomed the idea of seeing the head mistress again, but now that she was in the thick of things, she felt more like some heretic being led to the gallows than anything.  Barely a word passed between Netheel and Laera that wasn't out of sheer necessity.  Even then, things seemed overly cordial and polite.  Not once did Netheel ask her former student how she was faring, or seemed the slightest bit interested in hearing any tales from her travels.  At the very least, she thought she would be handing over her journal for review.  She was eager to do so, in fact, as she considered some of her writings to be quite sage, coming from one of the very few Wood Elves ever to gain such an insight into Teir'Dal culture.  But the subject never came up.  Apparently, all that mattered was the here and now, and the fulfillment of the Pact to Tunare's satisfaction.  Pleasantries came a distant second.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Laera came to recognize the look on the head mistress's face, and why it bothered her so much.  It was the exact same expression Rigel wore when he'd found her with Dreketh in Greater Faydark – an odd mixture of betrayal and stand-offishness.  She noticed Yeolarn Bronzeleaf wore it as well, what few times he bothered to pay her any sort of meager attention.  It was a look of removal, as if she were now an outsider for having spent so much time alone under the influences of a Teir'Dal.  Consequently, she felt tainted to their eyes – unworthy and corrupted, somehow.  She was more of a tool than a person.  She was like some heinous weapon, despised for what she was rather than what she did or how she was used.  <br>
<br>
Laera began to believe that was all she ever was to them from the beginning.  The pit in her stomach deepened every time that thought passed by.  She tried to dismiss it as she did all the others, but it inevitably returned to trouble her again and again.  For whatever reason, she couldn't let it go.<br>
<br>
Anyway, why should she?  These people were supposedly Tunare's eyes, ears, and voice on Norrath.  They were supposed to dispense Her light and wisdom upon all living things.  Was she now no longer worthy of that light?  Was she now a heretic of her own people in the same way Dreketh was to the Teir'Dal?  At least Dark Elves didn't sugarcoat their rejections, the druid thought to herself resentfully.  What did that say about Tunare's pious?<br>
<br>
Often, Laera considered confronting her superiors with these recriminations, imagining how such an exchange would be played out.  More than once, she even opened her mouth to lay into her former head mistress, demanding she be treated like a person and not some instrument of their designs.  But in the end, she always relented and kept quiet.  Though it might have felt liberating to get all this off her chest, it would do no good in the end.  Yeolarn Bronzeleaf would trump himself up and ignore the piping words of this little upstart, while Head Mistress Netheel would undoubtedly begin a lecture about how mistaken Laera was.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, all it would do is serve to bolster their original opinions about her.  She'd been tainted by the spawn of Innoruuk, and so must be treated as such.  It was a shame, she thought, since the time she spent with Dreketh and the things she learned in doing so were the very strengths she valued most for having undergone this journey.  Those were the very experiences she wished to share, but knew she would be spurned for doing so.<br>
<br>
Glancing across the way, she caught sight of Dreketh talking in low tones with Xon Quexill as the two Dark Elves rode side-by-side.  She tried to imagine what stories the shadow knight took pleasure in relating to her father, and envied the Dark Elf for such indulgences.  A part of her wished she could go over there and join them.  <br>
<br>
She supposed there was nothing preventing her from doing just that, but how would it look, considering the circumstances?  One flank of their assemblage contrasted starkly with the other, as each of the two races separated like oil and water.  On one side bobbed the tall, pale heads of the High Elves, while the shorter, blue-skinned Dark Elves marched along the other side, rivaling them.  Many a passerby stopped dead in their tracks at being confronted by such a sight.  In a time when rumors ran amok about open hostilities between the Elven nations, seeing a massed gathering of those same blood enemies together was enough to make even the most seasoned traveler scratch his head.<br>
<br>
But gather they did, heading invariably west across the northern plains of Karana.  Contrary to the young druid's private hopes, none of the inhabitants dared stand in the way of this motley cluster of Elves as they marched across their lands.  Most of the fauna of the Karanas avoided them as well, save for the odd griffin who blindly took exception to their invasion.  <br>
<br>
They made camp in the evening, just as the sun dipped below the western sky.  As was to be expected, the members of each race tended to gather around their own cluster of campfires, tending to their own needs privately.  This came as no surprise to Laera, but she shook her head nonetheless.  What was it about two individuals that they are able to bridge such cultural gaps, whereas two gatherings of their own races can't?<br>
<br>
Laera sat alone before a campfire, legs crossed, dwelling on these thoughts when Head Mistress Netheel appeared to deliver her evening meal.<br>
<br>
"Eat up well, child," she said in her usual tone.  "You will be needing your strength on the morrow."<br>
<br>
Laera felt like snapping back with a harsh retort that was poised on her lips, but thought better of it.  She realized this must be how Dreketh felt with her when they first started travelling together.  Even so, it took every ounce of restraint to keep from lashing out at the condescending manner of her superior.<br>
<br>
"Thanks," she replied instead, and left it at that.  <br>
<br>
Taking the tray laden heavy with pot roast mingled with an assortment of boiled vegetables, she stared into the fire as she picked distractedly at her food.  Head Mistress Netheel sat down next to her and, for once, attempted to engage in polite conversation.<br>
<br>
"It was a most lovely sunset this evening, don't you think?"<br>
<br>
"Mmmm…" Laera replied.<br>
<br>
"I think the sunsets in Felwithe are positively breathtaking," Netheel went on.  "It's such a special time when one can come closer to Tunare."<br>
<br>
Casting the head mistress a somewhat confused look, Laera shook her head.  What did this have to do with the price of tea in Qeynos?<br>
<br>
"It's important to take time and remember our roots, and think about the things that are truly important to us.  To appreciate all the wondrous things of nature that give us balance.  It's a pity we don't get to see the sunset in the Faydark.  I find it the perfect time to ponder on all of Tunare's creations, don't you?"<br>
<br>
"I wouldn't know," Laera muttered acerbically, taking an unusually large bite of potato.  "For some reason, I've had a lot weighing on my mind for the past few months."<br>
<br>
"Oh, but that is why it is so important," Netheel persisted.  "We mustn't lose touch with nature and the purpose of living.  Otherwise what are we advocating in Her divine work?"<br>
<br>
"You got me there."  <br>
<br>
"Surely you don't mean to say that in all this time, you haven't taken the time to relax and enjoy the world you've been travelling?"<br>
<br>
Allowing her forearm to rest against her knee as she sat, the young druid made a show of reflecting on the head mistress's question before answering.  "You know, I think I probably would have, had the world not been out to kill me and my companion at every turn."<br>
<br>
"Oh, nonsense," Netheel scoffed.  "I'm sure there were stolen moments of joy to be had every once in a while."<br>
<br>
Images of the downpour in the hills just north of Qeynos came to Laera's mind, as well as the memory of teaching Dreketh to catch rainwater with her mouth as it fell from the sky.  A small nostalgic grin crossed her face as she held on to that thought -- the first she'd felt was worth holding on to since leaving Highpass.<br>
<br>
"Yes, there was one treasured moment…" she said dreamily.<br>
<br>
"There now, you see?"  Netheel sliced at her serving of roast.<br>
<br>
Laera's face lost all trace of pleasure.  "Then the shadow knight you shacked me up with murdered a man by stabbing him through the stomach.  That, too, was a precious moment I'll never forget."<br>
<br>
The head mistress nearly choked on her food.  Chewing slowly, she stared wide-eyed at the young druid sitting next to her.<br>
<br>
"Then there was the rampant slaughter of gnolls we took part in for the cause of Tunare," Laera continued conversationally.  "Their scalps made the most quaint little slurping sounds as they were being yanked from their skulls."<br>
<br>
Head Mistress Netheel hurriedly wiped the corner of her mouth as she swallowed.  "You butchered gnolls?" she asked.  "That's barbarism of the worst sort…"<br>
<br>
"Well, we had to, you see," Laera explained.  "The Humans wouldn't let Dreketh into Qeynos unless we proved her loyalty by delivering at least five bags full of gnoll scalps from-"<br>
<br>
"Five bags!"  The head mistress was aghast.<br>
<br>
Blinking slowly, her face carefully neutral, Laera leaned in closer to speak softly.  "We brought in six, just to be sure."<br>
<br>
Netheel sat staring at Laera's face in stunned disbelief.<br>
<br>
"That was about when I learned how to take part in the vellin sar."  Laera shrugged, sitting back to continue eating.<br>
<br>
"What is the vellin var?" Netheel asked, her voice losing all trace of amity.  <br>
<br>
"Oh, it's one of the most sacred of Teir'Dal rituals," Laera replied.  "Dreketh taught it to me on our way to Odus to meet up with a necromancer colleague of hers near Paineel."<br>
<br>
"That… that's obscene, child!" the head mistress declared.<br>
<br>
Laera looked up, her eyes filled with mock innocence.  "Oh, not really…" she said, shrugging slightly.  "When you think about it, there's quite a bit less virgin blood involved than you would expect..."<br>
<br>
"That's enough!  I'll not hear any more of your blasphemy!"  Head Mistress Netheel tossed aside her plate, preparing to leave when she was stopped by Laera's hand on her arm.  Slowly, she sat back down, finding the young druid's serious eyes boring into her.<br>
<br>
"The vellin sar," Laera began calmly, "is a simple ritual of complete trust and confidence from one person to another.  There is no sacrifice, and no blood is spilled.  At least, not if done sincerely.  It has nothing to do with Innoruuk or the principles of hate."<br>
<br>
Netheel's mouth closed into a disapproving frown.  "Why did you lie to me?  Why did you make me believe it was some foul Teir'Dal ritual?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, it's a Teir'Dal ritual," Laera confirmed, nodding.  "Just not one to Innoruuk.  You assumed the rest.  I didn't make you believe anything.  You chose to believe what you did… about the Teir'Dal, and about me."<br>
<br>
Nostrils flaring, the head mistress scowled at her former student.  Her expression was returned in kind as Laera lowered her voice to speak in a gravely serious tone.<br>
<br>
"Next time, mistress," she said, using her ex-teacher's title, "If you insist on passing judgment, make sure you know who and what you're really talking about before condemning them.  I don't appreciate the conclusions you've drawn about me, and I'm insulted at your lack of faith in my principles.  All because of my friendship with Dreketh.  If such a thing is so abhorrent to you, then you should never have sent me away to form that bond."<br>
<br>
"Child, it was necessary to-"<br>
<br>
"Necessary, necessary… I am sick to death of this hypocrisy!" Laera shouted, interrupting.  "Everything is necessary!  To serve the greater good of Tunare, it's been necessary to make compromises.  But what you really mean is 'sacrifice,' don't you?  My sacrifice!  Not yours… mine!  Admit it!  Look into my eyes and admit it!"<br>
<br>
Netheel's gaze didn't move from the fire.<br>
<br>
"I have been placed upon Tunare's altar as a living sacrifice." Laera stated unequivocally.  "Everything I was is gone because I have befriended a Teir'Dal.  In saving our people, I can no longer be one of them.  In saving our race, you send me off like a lamb to the slaughter, and now my life may very well end at the hands of my friend.  Now you tell me, Head Mistress, is that right?  Explain how the sacrifice you planned for me is in any way different than if the Teir'Dal placed me upon their altar, and sliced me open for their god?"<br>
<br>
Again, the head mistress didn't answer.<br>
<br>
"Well, let me tell you something," Laera continued.  "I will remove the blood from your hands right now, because I make this sacrifice willingly for the good of all light dwellers.  Not for you.  Not for the Elf races.  Not even because you or anyone maneuvered and manipulated me into doing it, but because it's the right thing to do.  Any true follower of the Mother would, in the truest form of allegiance to Her cause of preserving life on Norrath.  Think about that the next time you're looking for an innocent to place on Tunare's 'bloodless' altar."<br>
<br>
Tossing her plate atop Head Mistress Netheel's, Laera stood. "Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be freshening up down by the river.  I wouldn't want to meet Tunare with hands soiled from the fresh kill we just ate."<br>
<br>
With that, the young druid stalked off into the darkness.  Head Mistress Netheel remained to stare blankly into the burning campfire before her, the glowing embers reflected in her eyes as she sat unmoving.<br>
<br>
"We chose correctly, my Lord Bronzeleaf," she whispered softly to herself.  "Tunare's mercy, we chose well beyond our wildest hopes."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The days passed with hardly a word from the head mistress.  Looking back, Laera held out some regrets over losing her temper.  After all, she couldn't expect anyone else to understand her, who hadn't spent so much time alone with Dreketh.  Oddly enough, however, she noticed that the ostracized look in Head Mistress Netheel's face was absent the following morning, and never returned.<br>
<br>
Although she saw Dreketh off and on during daytime hours, she was never given the chance to speak with her – not even privately.  Nights were even worse as the two factions of Elves made their separate camps in the closing darkness.  More than once, Laera considered slipping away for a quick word with her friend, but it remained impossible under the watchful eye of her keepers.  She knew Netheel would discourage it at best if asked, while Yeolarn Bronzeleaf would outright forbid it.<br>
<br>
Instead, Laera made due with her lonely nights, remembering fondly the comfort she felt when Dreketh kept her warm that evening in HighKeep.  The chills seemed a distant memory to the druid, as Xon Quexill's spell of deterrence kept them well at bay.  Still, the man's voice rang clear in her head, reminding her that she was still being observed by someone – some master necromancer who knew of the so-called Prime Cants.  Laera didn't pretend to understand it all, but she could see how seriously Dreketh's father took it.  It disturbed him that he was unable to unravel the mystery behind this spell – that much was obvious. <br>
<br>
Laera was diligent in keeping her blanket nearby as she slept and traveled.  Every so often, she could sense the penetrating gaze of the master necromancer riding his horse across the way.  Casting him a look, she would shake her head, privately indicating that the chills had not returned as yet.  He would then nod and return to his other business.<br>
<br>
Other business, such as leading their assemblage to their final destination.  Leaving the Karana Plains behind, the Elves soon marched on Qeynos Hills territory.  Calling the group to a standstill, Xon Quexill released a detachment of Dark Elves, sending them off to the north for reasons unknown.  When approached by Yeolarn Bronzeleaf, the master necromancer engaged in conversation that turned somewhat ugly to the Wood Elf's eyes.  A heated argument ensued that looked as if it was about to come to blows, when the high priest suddenly turned tail and sauntered back to join his regime.<br>
<br>
"My lord?" Netheel asked, concerned.<br>
<br>
"They're sending an advance 'scouting party' to pay Blackburrow a visit," he muttered under his breath.  Seeing the head mistress's uncomprehending look, he explained, "They are about to butcher a path for us through gnoll territory in order to gain access to the northlands."<br>
<br>
"We are invading gnoll soil?"  Head Mistress Netheel could hardly believe her ears.  "And we are condoning this, my lord?"<br>
<br>
"What would you have me do, woman?" Bronzeleaf snapped.  "Attack them?  Move our forces to defend Blackburrow?  We did not journey to the west to save the lives of gnolls."<br>
<br>
"But as Tunare's druid, I must stand on principle-" Netheel argued, caught short by the sight of Laera staring at her.  The young druid's face was awash with solemnity, as was the high priest's.<br>
<br>
"We can do nothing," he said with finality.  "The Teir'Dal have not revealed the vault's hiding place.  Nor will they until the very last moment of arrival.  Under such stubbornness, we are in their hands.  Be prepared, and vigilant of your charge, head mistress.  Focus on our goal.  It must be served, lest more than gnolls be sent to their graves."<br>
<br>
With that, the high priest steered his white mare away from the two Wood Elf women to approach his forces, giving them instructions as well.  Sighing, the head mistress pulled her cowl over her head, mourning the lives about to be lost in clan Blackburrow.<br>
<br>
Within an hour's time, the Dark Elf detachment returned.  Though marked by the rigors of battle, they seemed no worse for wear – not one of their number lost.  Saluting the master necromancer respectfully, the field sergeant reported that the upper region of gnoll territory was now secure, and safe for the advocates to cross.  Without hesitation, Xon Quexill issued the order to move out.<br>
<br>
The sights of battle were gruesome as they made their way through Blackburrow.  Gnoll bodies, hacked and bleeding, lay strewn along the ground and against walls amidst the mark of blood that played over everything.  Broken weapons rested near their fallen wielders as evidence of the poor creatures' struggles to defend their homeland as they were crushed under the merciless heel of the Teir'Dal.<br>
<br>
Head Mistress Netheel appeared nearly as pale as her High Elf cousins as she took in the brutal carnage surrounding her.  Noting her anguish, Laera leaned in to speak confidentially.<br>
<br>
"Would it make you feel any better if these were Crushbone orcs that fell to our forces?" she muttered.  Not waiting for an answer, she sat upright once again and ignored the head mistress's look.<br>
<br>
Mercifully, their passage through Blackburrow was short-lived.  Passing through a long tunnel, the Elven forces left the gnoll home behind, a bloody trail in their wake, to pass into the lands of the north.<br>
<br>
Not particularly fond of the confining tunnel, Laera nearly panicked at feeling a frigid chill shoot up her spine.  Worried that the chills were returning, she was about to hail the master necromancer riding ahead when she noticed everyone pulling out their heavy winter gear.<br>
<br>
"Here's a woolen cloak, child," she heard Netheel say.  Turning, Laera accepted the cloak from the head mistress.  "And you may wish to use that blanket of yours as well.  The peaks of Everfrost are no place for an Elf from Faydwer's climate, I assure you."<br>
<br>
Nodding her assent, Laera threw the cloak over her shoulders and brought the hood up to keep her natural body heat from escaping.  Pulling out her blanket stashed in one of her saddlebags, she draped it across her lap, keeping it at the ready in case the cold proved more harsh than the cloak could comfortably handle.<br>
<br>
As the caravan of horses rounded one of many bends in the tunnel, a pure, white light suddenly pierced through the darkness.  Laera squinted, shielding her eyes.  Before her lay an immaculate landscape of rocky crags covered entirely in unblemished snow.  Several of the Wood Elf scouts from her entourage waded through the powdery drifts outside the cave, at times up to their waists as they blazed their trails.<br>
<br>
"We're going to travel through that?" Laera asked, her eyes transfixed on the blinding spectacle.  It seemed the most inhospitable land Norrath had to offer.<br>
<br>
"Indeed we must," Netheel responded, glancing toward Yeolarn Bronzeleaf.  The high priest returned her stare with equanimity.  "And quickly.  Time grows short."<br>
<br>
Laera was about to ask what the head mistress meant, when the order came from the vanguard to press forward.  A mix of tan and blue Elves stood twelve abreast in order to stamp down a workable trail for the many horses and footmen to travel.  Snowdrifts filled the labyrinthine gorges and canyons, at times reaching heights taller than even those on horseback.  Many were the times the entourage was forced to make camp while soldiers dug their way through such drifts, opening the pass so they could proceed.<br>
<br>
Fortune was on their side, however, as the sun chose this day to shine brightly above the peaks of Everfrost.  The sunlight did more than warm Laera's skin, it also lifted her heart as they pressed onward to the north.  She imagined she could almost see the snow melting before her eyes as the sun's rays reflected off its glistening surface.  Smiling to herself, she could only imagine what such blinding light was doing to Dreketh and the other Dark Elves with their enhanced vision.<br>
<br>
Riding ahead, Xon Quexill raised his hand suddenly, bringing the other riders to a halt.  The ring of protective solders stopped as well, looking around confusedly as they tried to see what caused the necromancer to cease.  Xon Quexill looked around as well, his motions slow and deliberate.<br>
<br>
After a brief interlude of caution, the necromancer looked back, shooting Yeolarn Bronzeleaf a dire look of warning.  Though the young and largely unseasoned Laera Nellynwae couldn't fathom what the necromancer's glance could possibly mean, Tunare's cleric responded quickly and decisively.<br>
<br>
"Fall back!  Company fall back!" he shouted, taking Laera and lifting her from her mount to throw her across his own saddle like a sack of barley.  "Go!  Go!  Go!"<br>
<br>
Elves from both factions wasted no time in backing off from their position.  Armored men quickly turned to run back the way they came.  Horses circled and galloped, their riders careful not to trample their own soldiers underfoot.  All the while an ominous rumble grew to match the cacophony of so many feet making their desperate retreat.<br>
<br>
Glancing back as she held tightly to the High Elf's saddle, Laera saw it – snow falling in droves down one steep mountainside to the left.  The avalanche appeared as fine sand to the druid's eyes, almost looking like milk being spilled down the incline.  The sheer magnitude of so much snow heading straight toward her overwhelmed the druid's senses, as she watched her own panicked horse trying to escape the snowy death that awaited it.<br>
<br>
White swirling mists engulfed the creature in the distance, obscuring it completely in a matter of seconds.  Laera squinched her eyes shut, trying not to imagine what would have happened had the high priest not snatched her from that berth.  She was certainly no expert rider, and would probably have panicked in much the same way her poor beast did.  Silently, she thanked Tunare for Yeolarn Bronzeleaf's strength and reflexes as she clung even tighter to his saddle.  <br>
<br>
As quickly as it began, the rumbling faded, as did the frantic gallop of the high priest's mare.  Risking a peek, Laera looked back to where they had been to find the entire pass filled to capacity with the enormous, but oddly graceful arc of the newly collapsed snow.  The spectacle was marred in several places by large chunks of ice and the occasional tree that had been caught up in the chaos.  She estimated the wall stood well over a hundred feet high, possibly two, effectively blocking their would-be path through the gorge.<br>
<br>
Silence reigned in stark contrast to the bedlam that ruled moments before.  At first, Laera thought the stillness was caused by shock at what she had just witnessed.  But her mistaken notions were put promptly to rest as she squirmed against the pommel digging in her gut to get a glimpse of what lay in the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
It seemed snow wasn't the only thing blocking their path.  Standing grimly in a row stood tall Human warriors, armed to the teeth and with faces painted in a myriad of whorls and exotic patterns.  Laera recognized them as the tall Barbarians who inhabited the northlands.  The pass was filled with hundreds of these brutish-looking Humans, each clad in a variety of armor and carrying their own assortment of weapons aimed in the Elves' direction.  They cut off the any retreat no less effectively than the avalanche cut off the pass.<br>
<br>
In the tense quiet, the two forces faced off.  Seconds ticked away until one Barbarian wielding a crooked staff easily longer than the tallest Elf stepped forward and pointed his colossal hand at the avalanche beyond.<br>
<br>
"So witness ye the might o' the Tribunal!"  The man's powerful voice rang out to echo among the crags, his words heavy with a northern accent.<br>
<br>
"Who are you that crosses the path of peaceful travelers!"  Yeolarn shouted in return, causing Laera to cover her ears.<br>
<br>
"We are the servants o' the Six Hammers, Elf!" the Barbarian called back, making a sweeping motion at the entourage behind him.  "We are the deliverers of justice upon all who seek to do harm upon the populace!  Aye, even upon the gods and their mortal instruments shall it be delivered by our swift hand!<br>
<br>
"And ye not be peaceful by any means, follower o' Tunare.  Nor the company ye keep!  Both yer goddess and Innoruuk have been delivered their judgement fer crimes against all o' Norrath!  Even now the war o' the heavens commences in the deliverance o' their verdict by the Tribunal!"<br>
<br>
Horses nickered, sensing the tension of their riders and smelling, too, the suffusing scent of upcoming battle.<br>
<br>
"And what does this have to do with our pack of wanderers?" Xon Quexill's voice rang out.  "Surely you don't believe a paltry band such as this could pose any threat to the mighty Six Hammers of Halas!"<br>
<br>
"Dunna 'sult my intelligence, inkie!" the barbarian barked.  "Ye harbor the advocates o' yer gods in prophecy that will spell doom fer all lands o' Norrath!  Aye, even Halas!"<br>
<br>
"If your claim is true," the master necromancer replied, "then what makes you think our gods would allow your rabble to hinder us!"<br>
<br>
"Yer pale gods are a wee bit occupied at the moment!  The Tribunal has seen to that, backed fully by the other gods who're threatened by their actions!  That leaves ye and us to settle matters here, and by my count we have ye outnumbered eight to one!  I dunna think ye'll be treating the likes o' us the way ye dealt with the gnolls o' Blackburrow!"<br>
<br>
A raucous cry went forth from the assembled Barbarian soldiers while the Elves looked on, their faces grim.  There was no denying the truth of the man's words.  If anything, he was being generous with the ratio he touted.<br>
<br>
"It seems we are wedged between the Tribunal's gavel and bench," Laera heard Xon Quexill's voice speak in an undertone.  The necromancer had maneuvered his steed closer to their location during the verbal posturing.  Looking up, she found Dreketh seated on her own horse next to him.<br>
<br>
"In a literal sense," came the high priest's response, glancing at the wall of snow over his shoulder.  "In over fifty campaigns, I've never seen such odds overcome."<br>
<br>
"I have no gift for military strategy, but I'm afraid I must concur."  As the necromancer spoke, Laera slid cautiously from her undignified position to stand on the trodden ground.  "The only importance now is the survival of the nexus to fulfill the prophecy.  Our lives are meaningless beyond that sacrifice."<br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf nodded, his face a hardened mask.  Turning, he gestured to Head Mistress Netheel on her horse several yards away.<br>
<br>
"My lord," she said, approaching.<br>
<br>
"I charge you with spiriting the advocates safely from this place," Tunare's high priest instructed.  Lifting a gauntleted hand, he pointed to the fallen avalanche.  "How many of our number can your power accommodate over that ridge?"<br>
<br>
The head mistress considered the wall of snow and rubble stretching off into the pass behind them.  "On horseback, I think no more than six.  There is no telling how deeply the blockage extends, my lord."<br>
<br>
"Very well, select three escorts to aid in your protection," the High Elf said.  Turning he addressed Xon Quexill.  "I presume you will demand two of them be Teir'Dal, in the interests of serving your advocate?"<br>
<br>
"More than that," replied the necromancer evenly.  "I shall accompany them myself.  As custodian of the Pact, I and I alone know the whereabouts of Erollisi Marr's vault, and so must lead them there personally."<br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf's complexion turned a mild reddish hue.  "Of all the cowardly-"<br>
<br>
"Spare me your indoctrination of honor and sacrifice, priest of Tunare," Quexill raised his hand, forstalling the High Elf's words.  "I have seen the visions the prophecy has to offer, and it is not my destiny to die here with you.  Beyond that, there are other… considerations, I must attend to."<br>
<br>
Laera flushed hotly as she looked down at her feet, knowing that the necromancer referred to her unique predicament.<br>
<br>
"But you shan't remain without a certain amount of protection," the necromancer continued.  "I may be a heartless bastard and a coward to your eyes, but I do know the value of numbers.  Prepare yourself."<br>
<br>
His eyes rolling back into his head, Xon Quexill murmured in a guttural tone.  Arms outstretched, he raised his palms to the sky as his voice grew louder.  Joining it in a dark harmony was a rumbling not unlike the one accompanying the avalanche moments ago.  It reverberated among the crags and sheer cliffs all about in a much similar fashion.<br>
<br>
"Fallen armies of my Father, arise," the master necromancer finished, switching to the common tongue.<br>
<br>
Snow erupted from the ground all about in large clumps and wisps of glimmering specks.  Within each burst stood a skeletal warrior, clad in ancient ceremonial armor of Teir'Dal design.  Dozens of such eruptions took place amidst the combined army of Elves, causing the soldiers to blench momentarily.  After the master necromancer's spell completed, they found their number doubled in size, swelled by the ranks of the undead.<br>
<br>
His arms raised, Xon Quexill opened his hateful eyes to peer out across the snowy pass toward the Tribunal's army.  Seeing the once contemptuous and jeering assemblage now daunted by the undead spectacle unleashed before them, he recognized the moment of opportunity and seized it.  Reaching forth his blue hand, the Dark Elf necromancer ordered his hosts to the attack.<br>
<br>
Howls of rage emitted from the undead troops, shrieking an unearthly battle cry in defiance of the Six Hammers' attempt to thwart their master’s designs.  En masse, they rushed forward to their destiny at the hands of their hated enemy.<br>
<br>
Casting one last sneer toward the master necromancer, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf drew his silver mace from its holding ring fastened at his belt.  "If I live to draw breath upon this land, I swear I will find your cowardly corpse at the end of my weapon, Teir'Dal," he muttered.  "May we all live to see such a fate."<br>
<br>
Raising the gleaming mace above his head, Tunare's high priest shouted his own battle cry, taken up by those living souls among the army's ranks – dark and light alike.  In the cold air of Everfrost Peaks, the armies of Elf and Barbarian collided.<br>
<br>
Turning his back on the ensuing battle, Xon Quexill addressed those who remained behind.  The necromancer's features shown haggard and somewhat gaunt from casting so powerful a spell.  <br>
<br>
"We must fly," he said urgently.  "Quickly, before our forces are overwhelmed."<br>
<br>
Without hesitation, Head Mistress Netheel closed her eyes, weaving her hands in quick intricate patterns.  A spark of magic permeated the air around them as the mounts brayed, discovering that their hooves no longer met with the ground.  The spell of levitation was complete.<br>
<br>
"Come, child," she said to the awestruck Laera gawking at the floating horses as she herself stood earthbound.  "In your steed's absence, you must share my mount.  Hurry!"<br>
<br>
Laera nearly took hold of the head mistress's outstretched hand, but hesitated mid-reach.  She realized that all bets were off in this final stage of the Pact.  Hearing the sounds of war being waged behind her, it dawned on the Wood Elf that the lines once drawn through the unlikely band of soldiers no longer existed in the thirst for blood.  But not Elf blood, nor was it the blood of Barbarians or any mortal race.  <br>
<br>
It was the blood of gods.  Laera's quandary about bridging racial gaps was suddenly and gruesomely answered.<br>
<br>
The young druid realized it was time to do what she should have done days ago in the Karana Plains.  From now on, the Pact belonged to them – her and Dreketh.  From now on, she decided she was going to do things her own way.<br>
<br>
Looking defiantly up into her former teacher's insistent face, the young druid turned on her heel to take up Dreketh's capable hand instead.  Scrambling, she climbed atop her companion's horse to rest in the saddle behind the Dark Elf.  Her arms wrapped around her friend, she held firmly to the shadow knight's midriff as the small collection of horses rode over the otherwise impassible avalanche, away from battle's fury.  <br>
<br>
Away from death's icy grip.<br>
<br>

<br>
The Ogre dragged his hulking body down the corridor, a trail of blood marking every step he took.  Shredded remnants of chain mail armor hung limply from his arms as he pressed against the wall with one hand for support.  In his other hand rested the handle of a once viable weapon, now twisted and unrecognizable amidst the scorch marks and bloodstains across its surface.<br>
<br>
Similar smudges marred the Ogre's face as well.  He made a small attempt at wiping away the blood flowing from a gash in his forehead, but he knew it did no good.  The twinkles of magic didn't flow anymore since fighting the Big Scaly.  Not even the twinkles that made the hurt go away would work.  <br>
<br>
He tried to make them work.  He really did.  He warned the others that making too many twinkles made them go away for a while, but they didn't listen.  Well, Sparks listened, but none of the others did.  Instead, they insisted he follow them into the Big Scaly lair and help try to kill the thing.  And even then, the twinkles worked for a good long time, but Big Scaly is a tough one to kill.  <br>
<br>
After the twinkles stopped working, his friends began to die horribly.  Razors cut through them in big swipes, and hot fire turned them black so they didn't scream anymore.  Many Ogres like him died, too, plus lots of blue Elfs who tried making their own twinkles at the Big Scaly.  They all died, too.<br>
<br>
But not Sparks, he knew.  Sparks was too smart to die like the others.  He was smart just like an Ogre.  He, too, knew when it was time to run away.<br>
<br>
It was getting colder.  The heat of the lair fell behind as the Ogre stumbled his way down the corridor, and the cold place was returning to ice his bones.  That was a good thing, since cold made some of the hurt go away.<br>
<br>
It couldn't make the worry go away, though.  In the big fight, the Ogre had lost sight of Sparks.  This was not good, because they told him to stay near the blue elf.  <br>
<br>
He remembered well what they said.  "You stay near Lord Sparracis, Zogga.  He'll look after you good."  He didn't know why they called Sparks by that big, long name.  He always answered to "Sparks" well enough, and it was easier to say.<br>
<br>
The Ogre did his best to do as he was told, but he couldn't stay near Sparks.  The Big Scaly made twinkles of its own, causing Sparks to fly across the lair and hit the far wall.  There was no way the huge Ogre could keep up with that!  He tried going across to help his friend, but couldn't with all the fighting and the shouting and roaring through the big room.  Others needed the Ogre's twinkles to help them feel better so they could fight more.<br>
<br>
Now there were no more twinkles left – not even for himself.  More blood came out, making him weaker and colder.  He knew this was not good, because people who have too much blood come out of them sometimes die.  He needed Sparks to help him.  He needed Sparks to tell him what to do.  Sparks was good at that.  Sparks was the smartest person alive, even though he wasn't an Ogre.<br>
<br>
Sparks could even make the cold go away, if he wanted to.  He hoped he would find Sparks soon, though, because the cold was getting even worse.  And, of course, he had no more twinkles to make the cold go away himself.  Sparks would make it all right, though.  Sparks could do anything.<br>
<br>
Sparks was his good friend.<br>
<br>
Jittery words reached the Ogres ears.  They were those high-pitched voices again that annoyed his ears so bad.  Obviously, it was those goblins again.  They were close by, probably up ahead where the firelight was coming from.  The thought of fire pleased the Ogre to no ends, because as good as the cold was for the hurt, it was starting to make him sleepy.  And if he fell asleep, then how would Sparks find him?<br>
<br>
Pulling himself tall, the Ogre threw aside his smashed weapon and drew out a rusty mace from his pack.  It wasn't as good as his shiny mace.  He would miss his shiny mace, but this one would do fine to finish off those goblins by the fire.<br>
<br>
Roaring, the Ogre thundered into the small cavern with the goblins.  Sweeping his enormous arm in a wild arc, he brought down the rusty mace against one goblin's puny head, smashing it to bits in a single blow.  With his other arm, he backhanded another, sending it sprawling across the room like the Big Scaly did to Sparks.  The other goblins in the room rushed up to him, flailing their arms, but their blows bounced off his muscles like rain water in a storm.  One by one, the Ogre smashed, crushed, and ripped at the feeble creatures, not allowing even one to run away, just like he'd been taught.<br>
<br>
The goblins were weak, and the Ogre was pleased at this, since he was in no condition to fight any of the big ones.  Unfortunately, the fire went out in the scuffle, causing the Ogre to sigh sadly until he heard a voice echoing eerily through the place, calling his name.<br>
<br>
"Zogga?  Zogga!  Is that you?  Answer me, you half-witted imbecile!"<br>
<br>
That was definitely Sparks's voice!  He knew it had to be!  But where could he be, anyway?  He was probably lost and looking for the Ogre so he'd know where he was.<br>
<br>
"I here in the room Sparks!" the Ogre bellowed, a rivulet of blood escaping the corner of his mouth.  "I kill the gobbies, so it safe for you to come in now!"<br>
<br>
"Keep talking, Zogga!" Sparks yelled from somewhere down the corridor.  "Keep talking and I'll come get you!"<br>
<br>
"Okay!" the Ogre replied.  Blinking, he muttered some incoherent words.  "Uh… what you want Zogga to say!"<br>
<br>
"Anything!" his friend shouted back.  "Just keep talking so I can follow your voice!"<br>
<br>
"I found this room with the fire to get warm, but gobbies put it out before Zogga could kill them!  It getting real cold, Sparks!  Zogga getting very tired with no twinkles, so you hurry up, okay?"<br>
<br>
The Ogre's vision began to cloud and he could no longer keep his footing.  He knew Sparks would be with him any minute and use his twinkles to start the fire again.  It was only a matter of time, if only he could stay awake long enough.  But he was so very tired that he could hardly keep his eyes open.<br>
<br>
The Ogre awoke to the sight of his friend's blue face hovering over him.  Apparently, he had fallen asleep.<br>
<br>
"Sparks!  You came to help Zogga!" he said with as much enthusiasm as he could muster in the cold.  It must have got real cold while he slept, because now he shivered all over.<br>
<br>
"I'm here, Zogga," the blue face said solemnly.  "It seems you took your share of nasty blows from the wyrm, too.  Lie still."<br>
<br>
"Zogga been lying still forever," the Ogre muttered.  "Zogga need to go someplace warm.  Will Sparks please start the fire again?  It very cold in this place."<br>
<br>
"Zogga, it's too late.  I don’t think…" the Dark Elf's words trailed off as he looked at the Ogre's pleading eyes.  "Very well.  I'll start the fire for you.  I suppose it's the least I could do for your sorry hide.  Stay here, okay?"<br>
<br>
The Ogre nodded weakly.  He was too tired to go anywhere right now, anyway.<br>
<br>
Dark robes rustled softly as the Teir'Dal stood.  With a toss of his magic hand, Sparks started the fire again, much to the Ogre's delight.  It was going to be okay now.  Sparks was here.  Sparks would save him.  Sparks could do anything.<br>
<br>
"Zogga, do you know where we are?  I don't recognize this place at all."  Looking around, the Dark Elf inspected the small cavern.  "I've never seen the markings on this wall, so it's safe to say I've never been here before." <br>
<br>
The Ogre shook his head.  "No, this not where we came from to fight Big Scaly," he replied.  "Had to escape through the icy wall to get here."<br>
<br>
The wizard looked down at the Ogre quizzically.  "What are you blithering about?  Icy wall?"<br>
<br>
"Yes."  The Ogre nodded, pointing toward the corridor.  "Back down that way, Zogga crush down icy wall to escape Big Scaly."<br>
<br>
"Then what is this place?" Sparks asked.<br>
<br>
"Zogga dunno.  It cold, like all these places down here."<br>
<br>
But Sparks wasn't listening.  He walked around the cavern, looking at the walls like they were real important.  They looked pretty normal to the Ogre, but then his eyes weren't as good as blue Elf eyes were.  Whatever it was, those walls made Sparks go quiet and serious, like he always did when important stuff happened.<br>
<br>
The Ogre wasn't interested in important stuff, though.  Important stuff always made his head hurt and tummy rumble.  All he wanted was to sleep.  He needed rest so he could get up and kill more of those annoying goblins.  It wasn't easy, though, since Sparks kept wanting to chat.<br>
<br>
"Zogga!"  Sparks's whisper echoed through the cavern.  "Do you have the slightest inkling of what you just discovered here?"<br>
<br>
"Huh?  What Zogga do wrong now?"<br>
<br>
Sparks shook his head, his face still close to the walls.  "No, no, no.  You did nothing wrong.  In fact, you may have uncovered something very right.  Very right, indeed.  I must report this to Neriak without delay."<br>
<br>
"Oh, good.  Mebbe now Zogga sleep for a while?  Very cold and tired…"<br>
<br>
Turning about in a whirl of robes, Sparks faced the Ogre lying before the fire.  The Dark Elf's eager face turned solemn as he approached.<br>
<br>
"My dear dimwitted Zogga, you may have very well just unveiled the Teir'Dal's salvation over all our enemies of this accursed land."  Sparks said.<br>
<br>
"Zogga did good?" the Ogre asked weakly.<br>
<br>
"You did splendidly," the wizard answered.  "In one panicked frenzy of your dullard mind, you managed to blindly stumble across what has eluded the gods for millennia."<br>
<br>
The Ogre smiled.  He didn't understand most of what Sparks ever said, but he could tell when the blue Elf was pleased.  Even now, he could see the wizard's eyes glow with excitement, far more than he ever saw before.<br>
<br>
The Teir'Dal fell to one knee next to the Ogre's heaping form.  "It's a quite shame, really," he said, his tone ponderous.<br>
<br>
"Wha-?" the Ogre asked, not understanding.<br>
<br>
"It's a shame your days on Norrath are coming to an abrupt end, as it is," the wizard explained.  "Such a discovery would deliver wealth and power to you in Neriak beyond your wildest conceptions.  You could very well have become a living idol in my culture, if not for your tainted bloodline and muddled brain."<br>
<br>
The Ogre smiled broadly at the blue Elf's praise, his head resting in a red puddle.  How did that get there?<br>
<br>
"Perhaps it's just as well I'm unable to extricate you from your injuries," the wizard continued.  "For I would have had to end your worthless existence anyway.  You see, such status in Neriak would be far too much for the likes of me to pass up.  Either way, I have now reaped a future filled with avarice, and I have you to thank for it."<br>
<br>
"You welcome," the Ogre replied, still smiling.  Again, he didn't understand most of what Sparks said, but he knew he did good, and that's all that mattered.  "You take Zogga back to blue Elf city, then?"<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry, Zogga.  I forget how doltish you can be, even for a simpleton such as yourself," Sparks answered.  "So, I'll make it simple for your quivering mass of muscle to comprehend.  I can't take you to Neriak."<br>
<br>
"Oh…"  The Ogre's brow furrowed.  "Sparks?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, Zogga."<br>
<br>
"It still getting too cold here, even with fire.  Could you make more fire for Zogga?"<br>
<br>
"Of course, dear Zogga.  Of course."<br>
<br>
Sighing contentedly, the Ogre closed his eyes.  At last, Sparks would make things right.  Sparks always made things right.  That was because he was so smart, just like an Ogre.  He felt lucky to have such a good friend to look after him.<br>
<br>
In a blazing flash of light, Lord Sparracis cast his spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The cold, charred Ogre bones crunched beneath Dreketh's bronze heel, causing her to lose her balance momentarily as she made her way into the cavern.  Grabbing hold of the wall for support, the shadow knight kicked irritably at the offending debris, scattering it across the small room.  Several smaller corpses lay strewn throughout the room as well, in a variety of grotesque poses.  Unlike the Ogre's scorched remains, the freezing cold helped preserve the other bodies well enough to identify them as goblins.<br>
<br>
"Innoruuk's bane, what happened in here?" the shadow knight cursed as she stepped in from the corridor, followed by Laera and the head mistress.<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill glanced distractedly over his shoulder from examining the writings engraved upon the wall.  <br>
<br>
"I don't know," he replied, returning to his work.  "According to N'Threk, the wizard remained sketchy on the details of how he discovered this place."<br>
<br>
"A wizard?" Laera piped in, cringing at the signs of death all around.  "What happened to him?  Where is he now?"<br>
<br>
"He was executed," Quexill said dismissively, his hand tracing over the engraved words.  "Apparently the man's heedless lust for fame and fortune for sake of his discovery offended the priest's sense of righteous piety."<br>
<br>
Hugging her mantle closely about herself, Laera shivered.  <br>
<br>
Their journey to the caves of Permafrost had been a hard one, if not particularly long.  The Teir'Dal necromancer led them on an unerring course toward the north, which did little to ease the young Wood Elf's distress.  The farther north they rode, the colder it became, causing Laera to sorely regret losing her blanket in the avalanche, as she had.  As evening approached, the sun dipped low in the sky to her left, and Laera soaked in what few rays of sunlight remained before they were fully obscured by the pitiless horizon.  <br>
<br>
And here she was now, trapped below hundreds of feet of stone in a place she doubted had never once known the warm touch of sunlight.  The dreaded chills could have returned and she wouldn't even have known it, the druid thought to herself bitterly.  <br>
<br>
This realization did little to comfort Laera as she tried to rein in her fear of confined spaces.  Most of the underground passageways were smaller than any place she'd braved before, yet she held her irrational fears at bay out of desperation.  She was bound and determined not to allow her cowardice to control her this time.<br>
<br>
"That's an ancient form of Koada'Dal," Netheel said.<br>
<br>
Looking to where the head mistress pointed on the wall, Xon Quexill nodded.  "Indeed," he comfirmed thoughtfully.  "As well as Gnomish, Erudian, Elder Teir'Dal… even the unique dialect of dragons is included with this menagerie of the written word."<br>
<br>
"What does it say?" Dreketh asked, searching for a language she could understand among the inscriptions.<br>
<br>
"What you see before you are the words of prophecy, as spoken by the Queen of Love," Quexill answered, still tracing over the intricate symbols.  "It is written repeatedly in every tongue that existed during the days of Zeranon two thousand years ago.  The vernacular used is flawless to the era, even down to the beveling of the symbols themselves."<br>
<br>
"They're quite lovely," the head mistress commented, her own delicate hand tracing the more fluid characters.  "Most of these letters I've never seen before, even in the archives in the library at Erudin."<br>
<br>
"It is unfortunate, but many of the languages are forever lost in the passage of time."  Quexill backed away from the wall as he spoke.  "I fear it may be to our disadvantage, as they might prove crucial to unlocking the way inside."<br>
<br>
"How so?" Netheel asked.<br>
<br>
Holding forth his hand, palm toward the inscriptions, the master necromancer spoke a few short words of magic.  In answer to his spell, the words emblazoned upon the wall began to glow with a soft, blue-white hue.<br>
<br>
"Hmmm," Quexill commented, stroking his chin between thumb and forefinger.  "As I suspected.  All the inscriptions harbor the innate power of speech, not just one."<br>
<br>
"Meaning what, master?" Dreketh pressed.<br>
<br>
"Meaning that either any of the words could be spoken to reveal the vault," the necromancer mused.  "Or all of them must be spoken."<br>
<br>
"How can we tell which it is?" Laera asked, the light of the glowing words reflected on her face.<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill turned a sardonic leer to the Wood Elf.  "Pick a language you understand and find out, advocate of Tunare," he said, making a sweeping gesture.<br>
<br>
Swallowing, Laera stepped forward.  She was taught several languages in her training as a druid, yet recognized so few of the words hovering before her against the wall.  Figuring it to be the least difficult language she recognized, the young druid picked the words of the Koada'Dal, ancient tongue of High Elves.<br>
<br>
"Schyr'ellis drevin l'ar, fein lyerian mar'kest sen drevis par entralian crellis dem ogmaris.  Crakken ferlys den ferlon par lellyn weis seryl grenfyl.  Veryh ser'chaly ves pyra kellyn f'arless sen Norathalyn del'serryn kyro sen."<br>
<br>
Laera rubbed her eyes as the glow from the words winked out, surrounding them all in apparent blackness, by so sudden a contrast to her bedazzled eyes.  The echoes of her words were replaced by a strident grinding sound that proved bothersome to the Elves' sensitive ears.<br>
<br>
Like a dagger, a thin column of light pierced through the darkness as the inscribed wall split down the center, each half swinging inward slowly like a set of double doors on hinges.  Though visibly painful at first, their eyes soon adjusted to find what lay beyond the breach.<br>
<br>
Within was an enormous cavern, filled all around with stalactites hanging like ominous cave bats from the walls and ceiling.  Littering the floor were stalagmites rising up to meet their mates above, most of which fell short by several hundred feet.  The ceiling, in fact, would have surely been lost to darkness were it not for the blinding light emanating from the chamber's prominent feature.<br>
<br>
Though difficult to see clearly in the luminance, across the way stood the most magnificent structure Laera had ever seen.  Standing four hundred feet tall was an edifice of shining crystal embedded in the cavern wall, appearing as a graceful fortress or stronghold the likes of which no other finery on Norrath could compare.  Seemingly delicate spires, arches and buttresses heralded unparalleled craftsmanship in a complex network of whorls and lattices, marking the structure as surely being the true dwelling place of a god.<br>
<br>
"Behold," whispered the master necromancer, stepping forward.  "The vault of Erollisi Marr."<br>
<br>
As the four Elves approached in awe, Laera marveled at how the fortress could appear so dominating, yet so fragile all at the same time.  The idea of storming the place seemed laughably futile, but she feared breaking the silence for fear of shattering the impossibly delicate crystal with the harshness of her voice.  It was safe to say that the structure fostered – no, demanded respect and reverence in one shining monument to the Queen of Love.<br>
<br>
"The time has come," Xon Quexill said, his voice quiet.  "The advocates of the Pact must now use their combined abilities to unseal the vault."<br>
<br>
In response to the young women's unknowing looks, the necromancer pointed toward the metal gates – the only visible portion of the fortress not made of crystal.<br>
<br>
"The vault is embued with the essence of life," he explained.  "Only those touched by the power of Tunare, Mother of All, may approach and survive to walk its walls.  The portal itself is imbued with the essence of death.  Only those with the touch of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate, may breach the door lock and pass.  Once inside, you must vie to champion the cause of your respective gods in their struggle to possess the Cup of Ages."  Quexill looked at each advocate in turn.  "Failure to fulfill the prophecy will result in the extinction of your race and the ruination of your god."<br>
<br>
Dreketh turned her back on the shining vault to face her father.  The time had finally come for the two young women to seize control of the Pact.<br>
<br>
"And if we refuse?" she asked simply, her bronze arms folded.<br>
<br>
Quexill turned a wary eye to the shadow knight.  Apparently, this move on his daughter's behalf came as no surprise to the necromancer.<br>
<br>
"Then as custodian of the Pact of Zeranon, I will destroy you both," he said.<br>
<br>
"And what of Zeranon's Chalice?" Laera chimed in, coming to stand next to her Dark Elf companion.  "What of the gods' precious prize?  It will remain locked away forever beyond your grasp!"<br>
<br>
"Do not flatter yourself, child," Head Mistress Netheel answered in response.  "Though crucial to this dispensation, your role as advocate is hardly unique.  You will be replaced by another.  And they would be replaced by another, if need be.  And another.  And another.  Tunare's will is inviolate, child.  You shall champion the Mother's will, or be struck down in Her divine outrage at such high treason."<br>
<br>
Laera gazed darkly upon the head mistress.  Widdlethorp's words burned in her ears again, now that all pretense had been removed.  "You have been duped!  You are the playthings of your gods!"<br>
<br>
"Do not test my resolve in this matter, daughter," Xon Quexill warned, addressing Dreketh.  "In my rage, I came within a breath's width of ending your life in the Hall of the Dead for disappointing me.  Had not Kella N'Threk interceded, you may not have lived to see this day nor any other upon this world.  Doubt my sincerity at the risk of your own existence at Innoruuk's almighty judgement, shadow knight.  For, one way or another, you belong to Him now."<br>
<br>
Dreketh countered her father's words with a wary look of her own.  Pausing to exchange brief glances between her Wood Elf companion, she nodded, returning her gaze to the master necromancer.<br>
<br>
"I owe you my life and so much more than I could ever repay, Xon Quexill," she muttered darkly, her voice tremulous with emotion.  "But by virtue of the Pact and the lessons I have been forced to learn for its sake, I now understand the true nature of things.  I have no father.  All I have is obligation personified."<br>
<br>
Turning on her heel, Dreketh marched toward the lucid vault of Erollisi Marr, leaving the Wood Elf to her own parting words.<br>
<br>
"It seems that now I am not the only sacrifice to grace Tunare's altar."  Laera shook her head slowly, a lost look of sorrow in her eyes.  Turning quickly, the young druid rushed ahead to escort her companion as they stepped toward the looming gates.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Their lives and altruistic integrity left behind them, the two advocates of the Pact of Zeranon made their way to the gaping entrance of the vault. <br>
<br>
"You're sure about all this?" Dreketh asked out the corner of her mouth as they approached the metal door.<br>
<br>
"Without a glimmer of doubt," Laera replied evenly, her eyes staring firmly ahead.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight stopped to face the Wood Elf, her mien profoundly serious.  "Do you trust me?" she asked, point blank.<br>
<br>
"Everyone I've ever trusted has disappointed me in the end," Laera stated, her clear, green eyes unwavering as she tugged at her fur-lined gloves to remove them.  "You are my last hope to reclaim the belief that virtue exists anywhere on Norrath.  Not as gods or Elves of our races, but as individuals.  I beg you from the bottom of my heart, Dreketh.  Please don't let me down."<br>
<br>
With that, the Wood Elf raised her hand to cup Dreketh's cheek in her palm.  Closing her eyes, the druid cast her spell, endowing her companion with Tunare’s blessing.  Where once the mere thought of being touched by the goddess’s influence made her skin crawl with repugnance, the sensation had now become all too familiar for the Dark Elf.  She could feel it as her body became suffused with the druid's power – warming her, filling her, protecting her.  It was a sensation she'd come to grow quite fond of, and even missed while it was gone over the recent days of their journey.<br>
<br>
Looking once more toward the necromancer and head mistress standing alone in the distance, Dreketh reached up her armored hand to place her palm against the cold, metal door.  In a blink, the shadow knight's Touch was released, its powerful shock wave emanating outward in a dazzling play of bursting light and sound.  In response, the metal door vanished along the event horizon to disappear entirely from view, revealing little more than darkness in the gaping tunnel beyond.<br>
<br>
"Let's get this over with, then," Dreketh muttered.<br>
<br>
Turning, the advocates stepped into the vault of Erollisi Marr, disappearing amidst the disorienting blend of darkness and light – both opposite, but equally blinding.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All was quiet inside, causing Laera's ears to ring with the inaudible remnants of the shadow knight's Touch.  The massive hall in which the advocates found themselves arced gracefully over their heads to end in a pinnacle at the ceiling.  Ahead, it stretched off to what seemed infinity to the young Elves, interrupted occasionally by several T's and cross-sections leading off to either side.  The floors were padded with a soft, but supportive, resilient carpeting that effectively muffled their footfalls from disturbing the quiet serenity.<br>
<br>
Belying the crystal exterior, the inside of the vault was built from an unblemished, pure white substance neither advocate could rightly identify.  It had the appearance and luster of stone, yet no mark or impurity betrayed the graceful smoothness of the quarry.  Laera brushed one wall with her fingertips, expecting to feel the jarring coldness of the stone.  To her surprise, the material felt oddly comfortable, if not slightly warm to the touch.<br>
<br>
Though pristine, the décor was not featureless.  In various places throughout the hall, carved frescoes and colorful murals graced the walls depicting people of various races in equally various states of undress and posture.  Statues filled ornate alcoves ranging in size anywhere from the minute to the larger-than-life.  The eerily realistic portrayals were a celebration of the body in all its wondrous beauty and sundry forms.  Races of all types were revealed in plays of aesthetic eroticism throughout the hall, causing Laera to blush a number of times at some of the more obvious displays they witnessed.<br>
<br>
As she leaned in close to make a whispered comment to Dreketh, the two women jumped, startled at the sudden voice behind them.<br>
<br>
"Renounce your soiled apparel of the uncouth world, living mortals," the voice barked.  "For you trod upon holy ground."<br>
<br>
Whirling about with her companion, Laera's heart stopped at seeing who stood before her.<br>
<br>
"Ranin?" she whispered in disbelief.  "Ranin Treestalker?"<br>
<br>
Performing a courteous bow from the waist, the ranger's semi-translucent form dipped low respectfully before the advocates of the Pact.<br>
<br>
"In spirit, if not the flesh, chosen ones," his strong voice rang out again as he stood tall once more – a marked difference from the rasping quality it held in life.  <br>
<br>
The two young women stood, dumbfounded by their former protector's unexpected appearance. Laera noticed immediately how the disfiguring scar was now absent from the ranger's striking face, replaced by a cordial smile.  Though the man stood clad in the woodsman's fatigues he had worn in life, all trace of their careworn nature was gone.  Instead, the green and brown ensemble shown magnificently as if newly tailored – much like the normally dour ranger's disposition.<br>
<br>
"How is it you've come to be here?"  Dreketh asked, her voice carefully monotone.<br>
<br>
"The vault, this place," the ranger gestured all around, "is the repository for all things the Queen of Love holds most dear.  It is Her sanctuary, where the power of love and harmony rule uncontested by all persuasions to the contrary.  Making it the ideal place to secret an item such as the Cup of Ages.<br>
<br>
"Look around you," Ranin Treestalker made a show of the obtrusive artistry surrounding them.  "What you see are tokens and signets that make Erollisi Marr the goddess She is.  What you see is the culmination of who She is, and Her divine influences upon Norrath – Her divine influences upon you."<br>
<br>
Swallowing, Dreketh cast a fleeting glance to her companion as the ranger continued.<br>
<br>
"So, in respect to Her gracious invitation for you to share in this sanctuary, you must discard all trappings of war and hatred during your time here.  You will be quite safe from harm.  Fear not, for your belongings shall remain unscathed, awaiting to guard and protect you upon your return to the world of the living."<br>
<br>
"Uh…"  Laera blinked nervously as she stepped back timidly.  "I-… I don't know if I can…"<br>
<br>
Remembering the Wood Elf's habit of wearing nothing beneath her leather tunic, Dreketh masked her smirk with a gauntleted hand.<br>
<br>
Stepping forward, his face a play in sheer benevolence, the ranger placed a translucent arm around the druid's shoulders.  "Modesty bears little meaning in this place," he confided.  "But the Queen of Love wishes Her guests to be comfortable and content in their stay, above all else.  To those ends, appropriate apparel has been provided for you both."<br>
<br>
Without motion or ceremony, the druid's next breath found her clad in draping robes whose color precisely matched the curious stone surrounding them.  Reaching down, her fingers sifted through its seamless folds as the material slid effortlessly over her skin.  The breezy fabric covered her from shoulder to toe, yet remained comfortable to the extent that she had the uncanny, and slightly disturbing, impression of not wearing anything at all.<br>
<br>
Looking up with an astonished grin, Laera discovered the shadow knight similarly dressed.  The white garment had the effect of setting off Dreketh's pale hair as well, causing the Dark Elf's skin to turn a curious shade of night blue by contrast.  The effect was stunning, and Laera had to wonder what she looked like to the Teir'Dal's eyes.<br>
<br>
"You will find the Cup of Ages this way," the ranger said.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Contrary to initial impressions, the companions discovered they were not alone in the vault.  As the ranger explained, the vault remained a repository for all things dear to the Queen of Love.  Apparently, this included souls as well as pieces of erotic artwork.  Other ghostly visages besides that of Ranin Treestalker occupied the halls and inhabited the rooms of the sanctuary in much the same way Dreketh remembered the denizens inhabiting the Lodge of the Dead.  <br>
<br>
The spirits paid them little mind as they followed the ranger's lead, causing the shadow knight to pose her question.<br>
<br>
"Are all these souls bound to Erollisi Marr?"<br>
<br>
"Well… to some extent, as you understand it, I suppose," the ranger answered, rounding a corner.  "Though not all were disciples of the Queen of Love in life, each has been granted a standing invitation to dwell within these walls and enjoy all the comforts it has to offer.  Until recently, spirits came and went as they pleased, indulging in whatever whimsy match their desires at the time."<br>
<br>
"Why until recently?" Laera asked, taking in the wondrous sights all around as she followed.<br>
<br>
"Because of the Pact of Zeranon," the ranger explained.  "Through circumstances of Her own unwitting design, Erollisi Marr suddenly found herself in an eminently compromising position.  Her seduction of Feirral Zeranon ended in his ruination, true, but the Queen of Love was left holding the proverbial bag, so to speak.  With the Chalice literally in Her hands, it took every ounce of Her better nature to refrain from using it to serve Her own ends.  She knew all too well that if any deity of Norrathian influence were to partake of its power, it would spell the doom of all things.  Turn here.”<br>
<br>
Ranin pointed a ghostly hand off to the right, allowing the advocates to alter course before continuing.  "Her options were limited.  Not trusting anyone, even Herself, to drink from the Chalice in order to destroy it, She placed it here in Her sanctuary where it remained safely beyond the reach of the principal gods whose power and authority transcended Her own among the planes.  In an effort to keep Herself averted from temptation’s gaze, she placed upon her ‘vault’ the unique door lock and sent it to Norrath, effectively casting it out of arm’s reach.<br>
<br>
"As a consequence, the visiting spirits at the time have been trapped inside for these millennia.  Without recourse, they have whiled away the centuries, waiting for you, shadow knight, to approach under Tunare's sanction and unseal the gate with your Touch.  I was the first spirit to enter or leave this place in two thousand years, all due to the Queen’s desperate panic to secure the Chalice and its power."<br>
<br>
The small entourage came to a halt before an ornate door.  Ranin Treestalker turned to face his attentive audience.<br>
<br>
"Nevertheless," he said calmly, making no move to touch the door.  "The Chalice still existed.  So long as it did, She knew there was always a chance for its reclamation by those who sought to possess it.  That day is now visited upon us.  Stand fast, advocates, for the reclamation is now at hand."<br>
<br>
Silently, the door opened of its own accord, revealing a room of softly muted light.  Glowing spheres illuminated each of the corners as they floated above the palms of sculptured hands resting atop pillars sweeping up from the floor.  The remainder of the room lay bare, save for a circular table in the center, awash fully in a pillar of light emanating from high above.<br>
<br>
Breathless, the shadow knight and druid entered the room, their eyes transfixed on the object resting in the center of the table.<br>
<br>
The Chalice stood on its base, its equivocally goblet-like shape twisting in a grotesque curve, looking vaguely of plaster in its unwholesome, organic shape.  The surface was rough, the color and consistency of coal, as it jutted upwards to cradle the bowl amidst its assortment of craggy fingers.  A sharp glint of brass crowned the ensemble, the bowl itself shining brightly by merit of the light that enshrined the artifact.<br>
<br>
Once Dreketh regained the power of speech, she posed the question that had been hounding her since leaving Highpass.<br>
<br>
"Is there blood still inside?" she whispered<br>
<br>
The ranger's complacent smile broadened.  “See for yourself, advocate of Innoruuk.”<br>
<br>
Swallowing, the shadow knight approached the hideous object as if stalking a darkweed snake hidden in the brush.  Reaching out, her blue hand made contact with the rough surface, her fingers wrapping around the petrified base.<br>
<br>
Laera could barely contain herself as she watched her companion slowly lift the Chalice from its shrine, bringing it out through the light's edge with eyes closed and hands tremulous.  Holding their prize before her, Dreketh whispered something inaudible to the Wood Elf's ears before opening her eyes and peering into the Cup of Ages.<br>
<br>
A quivering breath escaped the shadow knight's lips, the crimson stain of defeated gods meeting her eyes as it lapped gently against the brass sides of the Chalice.<br>
<br>
The ranger’s voice spoke from the darkness.  "So witness the whispered convergence of power." <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"I don't understand any of this," Laera stated flatly as she and her burdened companion followed the ranger toward the sanctuary's entrance.  "You're just letting us walk out with it?  I thought Erollisi Marr wanted to keep it safely here for as long as possible?"<br>
<br>
"So she does," the ranger replied.<br>
<br>
"What of the whispered convergence of power?" the druid argued.  "What of sundered light and shadow being cast upon mortal soil and all that from the prophecy?  Erollisi Marr's prophecy!"  Laera leaped ahead to confront the ranger, stopping him in his ethereal tracks.  "Not a thing you have done in this Pact has made one shred of sense, Ranin.  I think you owe us an explanation."<br>
<br>
The ranger's relentless look of complacency stared back at the druid's insistent face.  "The Queen of Love knows your heart, druid of Tunare."  He looked Dreketh's way.  "And yours, shadow knight of Innoruuk.  Though you have been reduced to pawns by your respective deities, they in turn have become the pawns of Erollisi Marr."<br>
<br>
"What are you talking about?" the Dark Elf asked dubiously.  "It looks to me like they've succeeded in breaching your goddess's sanctuary.  It's the very thing Erollisi Marr feared.  But now you’ve as much as handed us the Chalice of Zeranon, to be visited upon the world."<br>
<br>
"Yes, but the Chalice remains out of reach of your gods, nonetheless," the ranger responded.  "She has every confidence of this truth, because she knows who you are, what you are, and of your clandestine intentions to keep the whispered convergence of power from reaching the hands of either of your patron gods."<br>
<br>
An uncertain glance passed between the two companions.<br>
<br>
"How did you-" Laera began.<br>
<br>
"It was preordained from the beginning, druid of Tunare," Ranin interupted.  "Do you believe that your devotion to one another was accidental?  Do you believe that your refusal to kill one another for the sake of your gods was a mere byproduct of the Pact?  No, but rather it is the Pact of Zeranon, by design.  None knows the mortal heart better than the Queen of Love, and of what it is capable.<br>
<br>
"The most important part of the prophecy was never spoken in the actual words, but added as an afterthought by the goddess.  'Only by the precepts of love shall the Chalice be unsealed.' "  The ranger's visage glanced between the two advocates.  "Scholars of the Pact believed it was a matter of implicit trust existing between two blood enemies in order to breach the vault, and to some small degree they weren't entirely incorrect.  It was the margin of what remained that brought about the downfall of their presumptuous philosophy.  The door lock was never meant to seal it away for all time."<br>
<br>
"Erollisi Marr wanted the Chalice to be discovered?" Laera blinked.<br>
<br>
Ranin turned to address the druid.  "How else was She to ensure its destruction?"<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked up from the weight of her charge.  "But that violates Her own prophecy," she argued.  "'The whispered convergence of power will reign unleashed upon all lands of Norrath-' "<br>
<br>
"'-by privilege of its keeper,' " the ranger finished the quote.  Pointing a ghostly finger to the Chalice in the Dark Elf's hands, he continued, "You are the keeper of the Cup of Ages now, shadow knight.  And when you destroy it, it will be of your own free will – your own privilege.  No one else's."<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf's eyes narrowed.  "What makes you so sure I'll destroy it?"<br>
<br>
"I'm not," the ranger replied.  "She is."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once again, the companions found themselves alone in the dark passage breaching the gap between Norrath and the sanctuary of Erollisi Marr.  The chess match that was the Pact of Zeranon left the two deep in thought over all that had transpired over the past few months since they'd met, and all the individual chess pieces involved that strove for their own particular checkmate.<br>
<br>
Cynicism took its toll as the Wood Elf began to wonder if life on Norrath wasn't just a proverbial game for gods who schemed and maneuvered, exploited and manipulated everyone for their own perverse pleasure.  What was a pawn, after all, but something to be sacrificed so that the game could be won?  Their conversation with the ranger left little doubt in Laera's mind what pieces she and her companion played in this game.<br>
<br>
Smiling, the druid chuckled softly to herself.  In due course, their gods had led them to the end of this journey across life's chessboard.  But somehow in their arrogance as players, the gods forgot to consider what happened to pawns once they reached the other side.  She and Dreketh were about to remind them, she thought to herself silently.  And together, they were going drive that lesson home.<br>
<br>
So deep in her musings was she that the Wood Elf failed to hear the subtle ring of metal as the shadow knight's sword cleared its scabbard.<br>
<br>
<a HREF="file:///storyline/storyIL.txt">Table of Contents</a><br>
<br>
<c "#FFff00">Chapter 28 - Tears of the Slayer</c><br>
<br>
Silence pervaded the space between head mistress and master necromancer, as if the air itself were made of cotton.  The Teir’Dal’s mere presence unnerved Netheel to no end.  It had always stuck in her craw that the forces of hate were the ones to first divine the whereabouts of the vault.  By all rights, it should have been Tunare’s own faithful who made the discovery, thereby seizing custodianship of the Pact.<br>
<br>
Now this vile necromancer, this Xon Quexill, is now custodian.  The sheer alien nature of the man grated on the head mistress’s nerves.  She found herself wondering if this awkwardness is what Laera had to endure in order to befriend her shadow knight companion.  Shaking her head, Netheel wondered how she did it.  The silence alone was a testament to the gap that existed between the two races of Elves.<br>
<br>
It was unnatural, what the Teir’Dal were.  The spawn of Innoruuk was an abomination to all life, twisted as they were of the true Elven form, which was wrought by the Mother of All.  Such fundamental rifts in nature could never be bridged, the head mistress thought to herself.  Not on a large scale, at least.<br>
<br>
Time slipped away in the disagreeable quiet of the cavern.  Netheel was amazed at the monolithic nature of the necromancer.  She fancied the man could stand motionless all day long without a hint of life betraying him.  Xon Quexill’s patience seemed endless in his complacency.  <br>
<br>
Now that she thought about it, that was exactly what annoyed her so.  The necromancer seemed so self-assured and confident, even as he sent his advocate – his very daughter, from what she gathered – into the thick of it.  Considering her own distraught feelings surrounding Laera, she had to wonder what it would be like to send your own flesh and blood in harm’s way.  It was something she couldn’t fathom.<br>
<br>
“What did she mean?” the necromancer asked quietly.<br>
<br>
Nearly jumping at the sudden, unexpected sound of the Teir’Dal’s voice, the head mistress strove to retain her composure.<br>
<br>
“I beg your pardon?” she asked, her manner strained in its politeness as she refused to look at the man.<br>
<br>
“Your advocate’s parting words spoke of sacrifice,” explained the necromancer.  “What did she mean when she said she wasn’t the only sacrifice upon Tunare’s altar?”<br>
<br>
Netheel pressed her lips together, still looking away.  If this Teir’Dal thought this was any of his business, custodian or no, he had another thing coming.<br>
<br>
“At first, I surmised that she alluded to my daughter,” Xon Quexill continued ponderously.  “But the more I thought about it, the less sense such a statement made.  Her words had the ring of finality, as if she herself had already become a sacrifice.  Further, if she were consigning herself to defeat at the hands of Innoruuk’s advocate, she would be the only sacrifice in that regard.  So, I am compelled to question the meaning behind her words.”<br>
<br>
Lips still pressed tightly, the head mistress considered the necromancer’s words.  Though he was loath to admit it openly between them, she could plainly see his only concern, in all his musings, was for his daughter.  Perhaps the Teir’Dal’s question was worth answering after all.<br>
<br>
“Laera wasn’t speaking of your daughter, necromancer,” came Netheel’s cold reply.  “Her words and their meaning were directed solely at me.”<br>
<br>
Quexill’s head turned slightly toward the head mistress, an uncomprehending  frown on his face.<br>
<br>
Netheel returned the Teir’Dal’s look with a hesitant glance of her own.<br>
<br>
“In becoming Tunare’s advocate in the Pact,” she explained, “Laera has been forced to turn her back on a gread deal of holy principles she had learned from birth.  In befriending your daughter, she’s forsaken all things righteous in the teachings of the Mother.  In this way, she has sacrificed all that she was and all that she held true.  In a cruel twist of irony, she has been made an outcast from Tunare’s teachings in order to serve as Her advocate in the Pact.”<br>
<br>
The master necromancer nodded, understanding that much of it all too well.<br>
<br>
“Though she makes this sacrifice willingly,” the head mistress continued, speaking to herself more than anything, “Laera has made it clear that in manipulating events so she has no choice in the matter, I have forsaken such principles as well.  That I too belong on that altar no less than she.  The only difference is that, for whatever reason, somehow I’m not an outcast as she is.  For I am not the one who befriended our blood enemy.”<br>
<br>
Quexill stood pondering the head mistress’s words and how they pertained to his own situation with Dreketh.  He found it remarkable how in a single sentence, Tunare’s advocate had said the exact same thing as his own daughter had said to him, and in a way only her superior would understand.  It earned the master necromancer’s grudging respect.<br>
<br>
“Your pupil is wise beyond her years, head mistress,” he commented.<br>
<br>
Netheel nodded her agreement.  “In the few months she spent alone with your daughter, she has gained more wisdom than her teacher has in decades of study.”<br>
<br>
Graciously accepting the reciprocated compliment with a slight bow of his own, Quexill returned to his musings amidst the serenity of the cavern.  <br>
<br>
Casting the master necromancer several uncertain glances out the corner of her eye, Netheel cleared her throat to pose her own question.<br>
<br>
“Did you make the selection?” she asked quietly.<br>
<br>
Quexill turned slowly to address the head mistress, his face a mask.<br>
<br>
“No,” he answered evenly.  “No, the selection was made by he who came before me.  A priest named Kella N’Threk.  It wasn’t until his recent timely demise that I undertook the burden of custodianship in the Pact.”<br>
<br>
“Any by then it was too late, wasn’t it?” Netheel said, her voice taking on a sympathetic tone.  “By then you were unable to spare your daughter from such a fate.”<br>
<br>
The master necromancer’s implacable face remained cold, his eyes glimmering.<br>
<br>
“I too have daughters,” the head mistress confided, turning to face the crystal vault as she spoke.  “Three, if you can believe that.  Though they’re fully grown now and have children of their own, I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to send them off to-“<br>
<br>
“To what, head mistress?”  Xon Quexill interrupted.  “To their deaths at the hands of the Teir’Dal for sake of some obscure prophecy to champion the egocentric cause of your pale goddess?”<br>
<br>
Sighing disconsolately at the Dark Elf’s sharp words, Netheel shook her head.  “Something like that,” she whispered.<br>
<br>
Taking a moment to consider her admission, Quexill joined the head mistress in watching the lucid structure some distance away.<br>
<br>
“I would remind you, head mistress,” he said calmly, “that my daughter is now bereft of the Touch, which places both advocates on an even keel.  It isn’t impossible that your pupil will emerge victorious to claim the Chalice in the name of your goddess.”<br>
<br>
“As always, you speak nonsense, guild master!” someone called out from behind.<br>
<br>
Turning about quickly at the sudden voice, both head mistress and necromancer discovered a moderately young Dark Elf male dressed in dark robes standing in the cavern entrance.  <br>
<br>
“K’Jartan,” Quexill muttered under his breath.<br>
<br>
“Why stop there, Master Quexill?”  The youth swaggered his way inside as he spoke, followed closely by a number of armed Teir’Dal close behind.  “Why not confess the real cause for your confidence in sending your own daughter off to a quest best suited for the likes of gods?  Why not reveal the reason you remain complacent in her safety, all the while turning your back on the best interests of your own deity?”<br>
<br>
“What’s going on?” Netheel asked cautiously, seeing the number of armed Teir’Dal entering the cavern grow to alarming proportions.  “Who is this man?”<br>
<br>
“His name is Glazin K’Jartan,” the master necromancer replied, loud enough for all to hear.  “He’s an accomplished Denizen of the Dead and my successor to the role of guild master.  He is also an arrogant, self-righteous despot who blames me for thwarting his designs on the title, aren’t you Glazn?”<br>
<br>
His impious grin widening, the young necromancer performed a sweeping bow.  “At your service,” he said blithely.  “And quite possibly the most generous introduction you’ve given me to date, Quexill.  I’m quite flattered.”<br>
<br>
The master necromancer’s jaw clenched at K’Jartan’s insolent display.<br>
<br>
“I have to admit it,” the youth continued, stepping forward with brazen aplomb.  “Your skill in thwarting our dearly departed priest’s schemes is surprising, even to me.  Beyond N’Threk’s assurances to the contrary, you’ve managed to leave no stone unturned… save one.”<br>
<br>
“What is he talking about?” Netheel asked, taking a cautious step back at K’Jartan’s approach.<br>
<br>
“He’s the one stone,” Quexill answered, his eyes riveted to the young necromancer. <br>
<br>
“The symmetry of enlightened self-interest was almost too perfect,” K’Jartan went on to say.  “Though I must confess, I had my reservations when Innoruuk’s priest first approached me.  After all, the old man was obviously crazy as a March hare, so the saying goes.  I didn’t want anything to do with him and his mad schemes until he revealed how my goals and the will of Innoruuk do indeed coincide.  In so serving His divine interests in thwarting this prophecy, he showed me how your death would become a happy byproduct, should I desire it.  <br>
<br>
“And desire it I did, obviously.”  The boasting necromancer gestured to his entourage of guardsmen.  “Mad or not, I realized the blind priest just handed me the victory for which I’d been thirsting all these years.  Not a day goes by, Xon Quexill, that I don’t dream of your death at my hands.  I figure if the Prince of Hate is served in your passing, then so much the better.  He will reward his devout servants.”<br>
<br>
“Reward by genocide, you mean,” Quexill spoke up.  “N’Threk may have revealed to you the spoken prophecy, but he’s done you a disservice by not sharing its vision.  If the Prince of Hate obtains the Cup of Ages, he will leave the Teir’Dal to perish at the hands of Tunare’s army.  I have seen it, as did N’Threk.”<br>
<br>
“Teir’Dal such as yourself, perhaps,” K’Jartan replied, gesturing.  “Look at you, casually conversing with the likes of her.  Even your lapdog daughter has turned from the principles of hate to embark upon this wretched Pact.  N’Threk knew she would.  She is inherently flawed and impure.  It’s in her blood.  It’s why the he selected her.”<br>
<br>
Quexill’s hands clenched, his nostrils flaring as he contained his anger.<br>
<br>
“But you are right about one thing,” the young necromancer continued.  “As much as it pains me to be the instrument of her unworthy salvation, she will live to relinquish the Chalice into the hands of Innoruuk.  She’ll have no choice in the matter, you see.”<br>
<br>
“You failed to best me in the trials of leadership, Glazin,” the master necromancer observed.  “What makes you think I would allow you to interfere with the Pact of Zeranon in any way?”<br>
<br>
“I would have thought that would be obvious,” K’Jartan shrugged.  “Tell me, Xon… what was it like encountering a spell of such magnitude?”<br>
<br>
Quexill’s eyes narrowed.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, come come ‘Master’ Xon,” the youth chided.  “You and I both know you attempted to thwart my observation that even now continues to prey on the Wood Elf.”<br>
<br>
“What is he saying, custodian?” Netheel demanded, hearing mention of Laera.<br>
<br>
“Don’t waste your breath, woman,” K’Jartan tossed an uncaring hand at the head mistress, his eyes never leaving Quexill.  “My esteemed guild master would never admit such a failure to the likes of us, isn’t that right?  This is the first necromantic web you’ve encountered in decades that you could not unravel, if I’m not mistaken.”<br>
<br>
Burning with questions of how the young necromancer was able to divine such a spell, Quexill retained his composure nonetheless.  If he remained silent, there was a slim chance the overconfident fool would let slip some tidbit of information Quexill could use to his advantage.<br>
<br>
“You see, while serving under the good priest’s sanction,” K’Jartan continued, as if sharing some private confidence with his guild master, “I have honed my abilities well beyond what they were during the trials to which you so aptly refer.  Honed to the point that not even you can thwart them.  It was my gift for serving as I am.”<br>
<br>
“Then why observe the Wood Elf, Glazin?” Quexill asked quietly.  “If it’s Dreketh’s cooperation you wish to usurp in surrendering the Chalice, you should be observing her instead.”<br>
<br>
“Two reasons.”  The youth ticked off his fingers as he spoke.  “One, to keep you off the scent.  Two, because if matters took a turn for the worse, there is every chance that the druid could, in fact, overwhelm and defeat your daughter in toe-to-toe combat.  Dreketh’s compliance can be had in a myriad of ways, but above all else, I cannot permit Tunare’ claim on the Chalice.  So long as the druid lives, so lives that possibility.  Ergo, she will be eliminated.”<br>
<br>
With that, K’Jartan flagrantly turned his back on his guild master.<br>
<br>
“You disappoint me, Glazin,” Quexill spoke to the retreating youth.  “I thought you knew better than to place such faith in a madman.  Follow through with what you’re saying, and the Teir’Dal will become extinct.  Kill the druid and we all perish!”<br>
<br>
“Save your desperate lies for someone else, ‘Master’ Xon,” K’Jartan scoffed, facing them once again amidst his armed guard.  “And by the way, it is not enough that I simply ‘kill the druid.’  She will die, but Innoruuk has mandated a far more tortured demise for Tunare’s advocate.  For her nefarious role in the Pact of Zeranon, Laera Nellynwae is to become a prize member of His undead legion – a memento of His divine ascendancy.<br>
<br>
“The observance has gifted me with a unique insight into her mind,” the young necromancer boasted.  “She will be transformed into the very object of her own nightmares.  Centuries shall pass as she’s relegated to fulfill the Prince of Hate’s every whim that pleases Him.  Her tortured and lifeless flesh will carry out every aspect of Innoruuk’s will, her soul never to gain the respite of her weak and absent goddess.  Such is the fate that is visited upon all those who-“<br>
<br>
Instantly, the Netheel’s hands became awash in flame.  <br>
<br>
“I’ve heard enough!” the head mistress declared, throwing her arms forth.<br>
<br>
Her spell cast, the young Teir’Dal became engulved in explosive flames, the ensuing blast knocking his neighboring guardsmen from their feet.  The ardent shock wave reverberated throughout the cavern, causing several stalactites to break loose and fall to the ground.  Cries rang out from the multitudes of Dark Elves as they tried in vain to escape the falling debris of massive stone all around them.<br>
<br>
Quexill wasted no time amidst the distraction.  Before the flames of the blast could clear, the master necromancer sent forth his own magical assault that would cause the young upstart’s blood to boil in his veins.  It was a spell Quexill prided himself in mastering and even improving upon as head of the guild.  He had every confidence K’Jartan would remain helpless to resist its effects.<br>
<br>
Contrary to all expectations, a blue hand emerged from the roiling fire towards the head mistress, who became surrounded by a dazzling shower of light.  Quexill recognized it as the debilitating spell of disease – one of the most powerful castings he’d seen, rivaling even his own ability.<br>
<br>
Indeed, it seemed his student had learned a great deal under the priest’s sanction.  Powerless to intercede, the master necromancer watched as Head Mistress Netheel crumpled under K’Jartan’s wrath, clutching at her stomach as waves of nausea enveloped her.  <br>
<br>
Thinking quickly, Quexill began casting.<br>
<br>
In the face of such power that appeared to transcend his own, he thought it best to start by limiting his opponent’s avenues.  Hands balled into fists, Quexill brought them out to his sides, forming an inverted “V” shape as K’Jartan’s feet became immobilized, magically rooted as they were to the ground.  <br>
<br>
With a look of pure enmity, the youth turned his attention toward his most recent assailant, the words of magical death on his lips.<br>
<br>
But Quexill had already embarked on his subsequent spell.  Bringing his arms up, the master necromancer crossed them at the wrists before his own bowed head, hands still clenched tightly as he awaited the youth’s inevitable attack.<br>
<br>
As expected, he felt the impact of K’Jartan’s spell spread across the protective shield he’d cast before himself.  Magic clashed with magic in a cacophony of light as the two necromancers fought their test of wills.  <br>
<br>
Ultimately, Quexill felt his shield split asunder, fragmented by the young Teir’Dal’s intractable wrath.  Falling back amidst the assault, the master necromancer became suffused with magical energies that pierced into his very being.  Life’s energies escaped him in a flood as his soul was tapped of its life-giving power.  So invasive was the spell that arcs of brilliant green flashed through the air between victim and caster, each spark drawing Quexill inexorably closer to his death by inches.<br>
<br>
Mercifully, the spell ended, leaving the guild master weak and feeble on the cold floor.<br>
<br>
“Come now, Xon.  Surely you can do better than that in your sleep,” K’Jartan taunted, standing arms akimbo among his fellow Teir’Dal.  “Here I thought to bring an army in order to defeat you, but it appears they won’t be needed after all.  My dominion of the guild is assured in the casting of a few quick spells.  I’m almost disappointed.”<br>
<br>
Gritting his teeth, Quexill brought himself up to rest on his elbows and knees.  Time is what the master necromancer needed now, but he could hardly stand, much less find strength to cast the spell he required.<br>
<br>
“Your dominion is short-lived, Glazin,” he croaked, still attempting to recover.  “The Lodge of the Dead will soon be void of followers to hail you as their leader.  Mark my words.”<br>
<br>
“And you mark mine, ‘Master’ Quexill,” K’Jartan replied.  “The power of Innoruuk has squelched your pathetic prophecy of an heretical goddess.  Be certain to give my regards to the Prince.”<br>
<br>
Closing his eyes, the young Teir’Dal spread his arms wide as he began casting his final spell.  Unable to do so much as kneel, Quexill braced himself for the end as a surge of power washed over him.  Strength bolstered his limbs with sudden electrifying energy, his muscles firming in the rush of hardened vigor.<br>
<br>
“Kill the little urchin,” the head mistress’s voice muttered from behind.<br>
<br>
No time to question, Quexill let loose the spell he desired, praying that K’Jartan was too occupied to counter it.  His prayers were answered as shades of inky blackness appeared from out of thin air close to the distracted necromancer, enshrouding him with their debilitating blindness.  Glazin K’Jartan’s refined words of magic fell to tortured cries of pain as the darkness slowly eroded his skin wherever it touched.<br>
<br>
Stunned by the spectacle of their leader’s plight as he writhed about, the Dark Elf guardsmen took a collective step back.<br>
<br>
Hands pressed to his eyes, K’Jartan realized what had happened.  His vision impaired as it was amid the clinging darkness surrounding him, his feet still rooted firmly in place as they were, he was unable to press the attack or effect a retreat.  The once self-assured Teir’Dal was now rendered helpless.<br>
<br>
“Kill him, you imbeciles!” he shouted, gesturing frantically in the master necromancer’s direction.<br>
<br>
“That won’t be necessary,” a female voice called out, forestalling any advance the guardsmen might have made.<br>
<br>
All eyes, save for K’Jartan’s, fell on the vault entrance to find Innoruuk’s advocate standing alone in the cavern’s light, framed by the darkness of the tunnel behind her.  Clad in her mother’s bronze, Dreketh stood tall, her face implacable as marble.  <br>
<br>
In the hushed silence, Xon Quexill, much of his strength restored, shuffled quietly toward the crystal steps leading up to his daughter, careful not to touch them lest he feel the shield’s wrath.  Not a trace of emotion betrayed the shadow knight as her cool azure eyes observed the approach of her former master below.<br>
<br>
“Advocate of Innoruuk,” he said in a measured voice.  “Where is the Chalice of Zeranon?”<br>
<br>
Her face still cold and passionless, Dreketh reached an armored hand behind her back.  With the utmost care, for fear of spilling any of its contents, she brought forth her prize for all to see.  A hushed stirring emitted from those assembled at seeing its stony black surface and gleaming brass bowl resting atop.<br>
<br>
“Advocate of Innoruuk”, Quexill continued, speaking slowly and with utmost care.  “Where is your companion?”<br>
<br>
In response, the shadow knight’s lip curled into a sneer.  Bringing her other hand up, she drew her father’s sword from over her shoulder, the sound of steel echoing about the cavern.  Without a word, she held aloft the shining weapon high over her head, its surface reflecting the cavern’s light in glaring contrast to the tunnel beyond.<br>
<br>
Head Mistress Netheel let out a strangled cry.<br>
<br>
“Look closely,” Dreketh said, her voice matching the calm of the necromancer’s.  “Look hard, and you will see the truth.”<br>
<br>
His eyes narrowing, Quexill examined the blade displayed proudly above him.  All appeared as it should be until he noticed something was oddly different about it.  Even at this distance, he plainly recognized the weapon as her birthfather’s, except the two-handed blade only reached a length comparable to that of a long sword – a noticeably shorter class of weapon.  Instead of tapering to a sharpened point, the blade’s end was squared off, a healthy portion of its tip missing.<br>
<br>
Seeing the look of realization mark her father’s face, the shadow knight thrust the sword out into the open air.   Breathless moments passed as the sundered weapon fell to land against the steps at Quexill’s feet with a jarring clatter.<br>
<br>
“Though the blood of gods yet mingles in the Cup of Ages,” declared Dreketh, “The blood of innocents will not be spilled by the sword of my father.  Now or ever.”<br>
<br>
With this, Tunare’s advocate stepped from the shadows of the tunnel to meet the astonished gasps of those assembled.  Clad all in leather, the Wood Elf shown wholly unscathed as she took her place next to her Dark Elf companion, her manner one of composed dignity.<br>
<br>
“As it was spoken by the tongue of Erollisi Marr, so it shall be,” Dreketh announced, holding forth the Cup of Ages before her.  “Sundered light and shadow will be cast upon mortal soil wielded…”<br>
<br>
The echoes of her voice died out as every living soul hung on her very words.<br>
<br>
“…in the hand of innocence!” she finished, turning to present the Chalice to the Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
Commotion broke out as the voices of a hundred panicked Teir’Dal shouted in desperation to the shadow knight.  Threats were levied and pleas were made as the druid’s smooth hands took possession of the accursed artifact of power.<br>
<br>
Glazin K’Jartan clawed furiously at his afflicted eyes, his lips cursing in bitter frustration.  Time was slipping away from beneath his feet.  Even now, it may already be too late as Tunare’s advocate drank of the blood of the Chalice, forever putting his ambitions and those of his god to rest.  Never before had he considered failure to be an option until that moment as he railed impotently against the enchantment, yearning for it to dissipate by sheer force of will.<br>
<br>
As if in answer to his prayers, the necromancer’s vision cleared in a piercing glow of light as it filled his eyes, causing him to wince in the brightness.  Blinking furiously to clear the blur, K’Jartan saw the Wood Elf standing atop the crystal staircase, her face becoming obscured by the stony blackness of the Chalice as she began to tilt her head back.<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill felt the enchantment diminish as well.  Turning his back on events unfolding above him, the master necromancer whirled about to find his liberated victim squinting painfully in the light.  Realizing there was no time to recast the darkness, Quexill desperately brought his hands up to weave a magical shield shield of force before the Wood Elf, hoping to protect her from K’Jartan’s imminent spell.<br>
<br>
His efforts were for naught as the young necromancer released the spell linked to his observation, shattering the master necromancer’s feeble shield into shards numbering a thousand strong.  Having mounted its energies over the course of days, the nefarious spell impacted with its target, the blood of gods half an inch from the druid’s lips.<br>
<br>
Laera felt the magic penetrate her being, causing her muscles to seize violently.  Blood from the Chalice spilled onto the crystalline floor as the dreadful chills returned to haunt her with a vengeance.  Icy fingers ripped through her spine, splitting off to course down her arms and legs like hideous snakes worming their way through her body.  The world spun in a bewildering tumult as she lost control of her legs and fell, landing in the firm, reassuring clutches of her trusted companion.<br>
<br>
Catching the druid in one arm, Dreketh grabbed hold of the Chalice before it escaped the Wood Elf’s flaccid hands – before any more of the precious blood fell useless to the ground.  Her breath caught in her throat as she glimpsed the inside of the bowl.<br>
<br>
A single man’s cry of victory went up.  Arms outstretched and palms raised, K’Jartan appealed himself to the ceiling, and presumably beyond to the ears of his god.<br>
<br>
“It is done!” he shouted maniacally.  “Innoruuk!  Prince of Hate!  Thy pious servant has stripped Tunare of Her prize!”<br>
<br>
“What have you done!” Dreketh screamed as she gently lowered the convulsing druid to the floor.  “She was about to destroy the Chalice, not surrender it to Tunare!”<br>
<br>
“All the same, I have secured Innoruuk’s claim on the Cup of Ages!”  The necromancer gestured to the bloodstained crystal floor at the shadow knight’s feet.  “See!  The blood of the Chalice is spent!  You have no power to prevent it!  None of you!  I invoke thee, almighty Prince of Hate!  Come now and claim thy prize!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh stood to confront the boisterous necromancer in the distance.  Held firmly in the grasp of her bronze fingers, she raised Zeranon’s Chalice at arm’s length toward the necromancer, her azure eyes peering at him from over the brass rim.<br>
<br>
“You spout supposition as though it were fact!” she called out.  “You’ve not seen the inside of the Chalice to verify the truth of your words!”<br>
<br>
“Spare me your empty posturing, Elf lover!” K’Jartan scoffed, calling her bluff.  ”There lies enough blood at your feet to fill that bowl!”<br>
<br>
“Your eyes must be failing you, dear Glazin,” the shadow knight shouted back with conviction.  “There lies enough blood at my feet to fill this Chalice thrice over!”<br>
<br>
Dreketh brought the Cup of Ages to her lips.  Closing her eyes, Innoruuk’s advocate slowly inclined  her head, tilting the Chalice back as if to drink.  <br>
<br>
Chuckling his own mirth at the shadow knight’s hapless ploy, K’Jartan’s laughter ceased abruptly at the sight of twin crimson trails spilling from the corners of her mouth.  It was undeniable.  Blood coursed down Dreketh’s chin and onto her chest as she drank deeply of the whispered convergence of power.<br>
<br>
The cloying taste of blood washed over her tongue as she swallowed.  Every closure of her throat sent mouthfuls of the immortal liquid into her person, its raw power effusing every corner of the shadow knight’s soul.  Visions and memories of the gods passed unbidden through her mind, sending her consciousness soaring past the boundaries of dimensional space.  She saw vast worlds whose numbers reached beyond all comprehension, each one harboring its own manner of life, both grotesque and beautiful.  The power intoxicated Dreketh like no liquor ever could, seducing her with vibrant images of countless possibilities now open to her.  Sultry temptations ran like flame through her very essence.  Through it all, she began to understand the true nature of the Chalice, and why the Queen of Love sought so desperately to hide it away from the likes of gods – even Herself.<br>
<br>
With determination born of the strident, practical nature of mortality, Dreketh seized control of the quixotic power.  Her emotions firmly leashed, the Dark Elf’s consciousness returned to Norrath as she opened her eyes and lowered the empty Cup of Ages – its power now embodied by its keeper.<br>
<br>
Three succinct claps echoed in the cavern, Glazin K’Jartan’s hands languidly offering his applause.<br>
<br>
“Bravo,” he said, his grave expression adding the lie his words.  “Congratulations, shadow knight.  The whispered convergence of power is now yours to command for as long as the Cup of Ages exists.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh cast a hesitant look to her father below.  The master necromancer’s face shown as implacable as his daughter’s as he watched history unfold before his very eyes.  It was as if he feared making the slightest movement, lest the prophecy unravel, dooming them all to oblivion.<br>
<br>
“Ironically, the choice of evils burdens you nonetheless,” K’Jartan continued, drawing the shadow knight’s attention to himself again.<br>
<br>
Head Mistress Netheel sidled up to Xon Quexill, a hand clutched against her twisting abdomen from the magical disease.<br>
<br>
“What is he saying?” she asked in a whisper.<br>
<br>
Quexill muttered under his breath.  “As our illustrious Zeranon discovered, the power of the Chalice is not absolute.  Dreketh now has a difficult choice to make.”<br>
<br>
K’Jartan spread his arms wide, taking a deep breath of stale air in through his nose.  “Feel that, shadow knight?” he asked.  “Do you feel His divine presence?  Upon invocation, Innoruuk awaits in his infinite patience.”<br>
<br>
“Meaning what?” Netheel whispered, grasping at the master necromancer’s robes.<br>
<br>
Quexill hesitated in his reply.  “Meaning the Prince of Hate is poised, ready to claim the Chalice at the earliest opportunity.  For now, the whispered convergence of power holds Him at bay.  Should there be a lapse in that power…”<br>
<br>
“Time grows short,” K’Jartan continued to taunt.  “Every second brings your loved one closer to destiny.  Choose.”<br>
<br>
Terrible meaning struck the head mistress as she looked over to the forgotten druid lying at the shadow knight’s feet.  Should Dreketh choose to destroy the Chalice, it sentences Laera to an unspeakable fate as one of the undead.  Should she use her power to save her friend, Innoruuk claims the Chalice.  A quivering breath escaped Head Mistress Netheel’s chest as she fell to her knees beside the master necromancer.<br>
<br>
A choice of lesser evils.<br>
<br>
Muscles in the shadow knight’s temples worked frantically as she thought of what to do.  The whispered convergence of power flowed through her veins, but like the gods whose sundered light and shadow thrived within her, she was no master of time.  All the power and knowledge she gained served little more than to mock her as she fell victim to one of life’s simple antilogies.<br>
<br>
“Dreketh…” the druid’s choked voice spoke.  “Dreketh, where are you?  I can’t see you anymore.”<br>
<br>
Turning, the shadow knight discarded such troublesome thoughts in favor of attending her friend.  Kneeling over the Wood Elf, she brought her face to hover before Laera’s eyes as they stared sightlessly up at the cavern above.<br>
<br>
“I’m here,” she whispered, looking into her friend’s face.  “Do you see me?”<br>
<br>
Laera swallowed nervously.  “No… I saw the ceiling before, but now I can’t,” she replied.  <br>
<br>
Reaching out uncertainly in search of the shadow knight, Laera encountered the cold, reassuring grip of her friend’s gauntleted hand.  With a sigh of relief, she held tightly to that grip with every ounce of her strength.<br>
<br>
“They’re coming for me,” she whispered.  “They’re getting closer, Dreketh, and I can’t stop them.  I can’t…”  The druid’s chin furrowed as she shook her head along the ground.  “Merciful Tunare, I can’t stop them from taking me!”<br>
<br>
“I know,” the shadow knight said, holding fast to her friend.<br>
<br>
The druid’s brow twisted, growing terrified.  “I’m so scared,” she gasped, her voice breaking in a sob.  “Please don’t let them take me, Dreketh.  Please, please don’t let them!”<br>
<br>
Scowling back the tears that threatened to escape her strict control, Dreketh prepared herself for the most difficult words she’d spoken in her life.<br>
<br>
“I can’t,” she muttered, her own voice breaking.  “Gods forgive me, I can’t.”<br>
<br>
Biting her lip, Laera’s face twisted in agony, her nostrils flaring with the silent heaves that seized her.  <br>
<br>
“You promised me,” she mouthed, her voice barely audible.  “You promised not to let me down, Dreketh.  You promised not to let me down!”<br>
<br>
The tears breached her defenses as Dreketh closed her eyes tightly shut.   Her head shaking from side to side, she buried her forehead against their clenched hands.<br>
<br>
“Please,” Laera made one last desperate plea before the endless night took her.  “Please, my friend, end it before it’s too late.  Allow my soul to escape-”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf’s head snapped up furiously.  <br>
<br>
“I won’t kill you!” she shrieked in anguish at the Wood Elf, the image of her friend blurred by the tears that now ran unchecked down her face.<br>
<br>
Mouth agape, Laera’s eyes moved precariously, wavering about to finally focus on the Dark Elf’s grief-stricken face next to her.  Releasing one of her hands from their mutual grip, she brought it up to brush aside the stark white hair dangling in her companion’s face.<br>
<br>
“There you are,” she said, her face breaking into a fond smile. <br>
<br>
The sight of the Teir’Dal’s blue features filled Laera’s spirit as she traced them with her fingertips.  The supple curves of her jaw, the tapering of her cheeks as they met with her lips entranced the Wood Elf, fascinated as she watched her own hand brush against the warmth of her friend’s skin – the blue skin that wouldn’t wash away.  She hadn’t realized it before, but her friend was truly quite beautiful.  She couldn’t remember a time when the Dark Elf’s eyes looked more lovely, now that the cruel cynicism was missing from within.  <br>
<br>
“It will be all right, my friend,” Laera confided, all traces of fear gone from her fading eyes.  “Tunare awaits me.  I feel her call.  Please, Dreketh… use your spell.  Please… use it to make us one.  Make us one forever.”<br>
<br>
Her own chest heaving uncontrollably, Dreketh lifted her tear-streaked face to the ceiling.  The Wood Elf’s meaning was unmistakable, even as her grip loosened on the shadow knight’s hand.  Looking down, the Dark Elf took in the limp form of her companion’s body, no trace of cognizance filling the emerald green eyes.<br>
<br>
The time was now, if it was going to be at all.<br>
<br>
Frantically, Dreketh pulled at her gauntlets, the very things that separated her from her friend’s touch.  With fevered quickness, she yanked off the infernal things, tossing them aside as she grabbed hold of the Wood Elf’s shoulders to lay her auburn-haired head in her lap.  Taking the druid’s hands in one of her own, she placed them palm down against the cadeucal symbol gracing the center of Laera’s chest.<br>
<br>
Hunching over, Dreketh pressed her tremulous lips against her friend’s forehead in an extended kiss, the tears of her cheek falling upon the Wood Elf’s brow.  <br>
<br>
Holding her friend solidly against herself, the shadow knight whispered into the Wood Elf’s pointed ear.<br>
<br>
“I love you.”<br>
<br>
Magic surged from within as it flowed through her arm and into her companion’s unresisting body, leeching away what scant energies of her life remained.  Within a breath’s time, the shrill sound of the spell faded away, leaving Dreketh’s pain-filled cry to fill the cavern as it too fell to placid silence.<br>
<br>
The cavern’s occupants watched quietly in the tranquil peace that ensued as the Dark Elf spared herself a few brief moments before letting go of her friend.  Dreketh held tightly, finding a small amount of comfort in her one-sided embrace.<br>
<br>
Sniffling softly, she pulled back to look into the lifeless eyes of Laera Nellynwae as they gazed up to the ceiling, their spark of life forever gone.<br>
<br>
Jaw muscles clenched, Dreketh gritted her teeth in anguish when the glimmer of brass caught the corner of her eye.  Somehow in all the turmoil, she had absently set down the Chalice of Zeranon to rest on the floor next to her leg.  <br>
<br>
Fierce anger rushed in to fill the void as the Cup of Ages shown reflected in the shadow knight’s eyes.  This was the real instrument of her pain.  This vile artifact had been the one true source of her torment from the very first day Kella N’Threk coerced her into making that dreadful request to abandon her father’s guild.  This was the object responsible for her torture in Neriak, and for the death of Ranin Treestalker who shielded her very life with his own, down to his last breath on this world.<br>
<br>
This was the tool that spelled the doom of the greatest, most devout friend the shadow knight ever had.<br>
<br>
Sliding on her knees through half-dried blood on the crystal floor, Dreketh moved to straddle Zeranon’s Chalice, taking it up in both her hands.  Eyes filled with the hatred of her race, she raised the item before her, the brass bowl winking its ridicule in the light.<br>
<br>
“So ends your onerous legacy, Zeranon…” she growled.  “Rot in the abyss, you reckless bastard.”<br>
<br>
With all her strength, Dreketh brought down the Cup of Ages to strike the floor between her bronze knees.  Obsidian pieces scattered across the floor in a resounding thunderclap, the brass bowl tumbling in the chaos of its destruction at the hands of the merciless shadow knight.<br>
<br>
It’s power unleashed, the elements answered the Chalice’s demise with their own ire.  A gale twisted within the shock wave’s front as it emanated from the Dark Elf, laced all about with flame and lighting in a dissonance of blinding rage all through the cavern.  The very bedrock trembled violently beneath their feet, causing the vault of Erollisi Marr to shudder on its foundation.  Fracturing under such otherworldly stress, the crystal façade splintered in loud, head-piercing cracks as it too added to the bedlam of the cavern.<br>
<br>
Xon Quexill shielded himself as best he could from the pandemonium that ruled supreme in his world.  Risking a peek of concern, he looked up to where his daughter knelt moments before, only to find her standing tall, not a hair on her head so much as stirred by the breath-stealing wind.  Cowed by the Chalice’s unfettered fury, the master necromancer watched as his daughter knelt on one knee to take up her fallen companion in her arms as she would a newborn babe.<br>
<br>
So burdened, Dreketh stood, the lifeless form of Laera Nellynwae clutched to her chest.  Turning, oblivious to the upheaval surrounding her, she descended the crystal stairs with a measured step, her face solemn.  Blinking, Quexill realized that Dreketh was granting her friend a solitary procession in what was to be the only memorial service the Wood Elf was likely to receive on Norrath.<br>
<br>
As feet met with stone, a shining circle of light went forth from the shadow knight to spread across the entire cavern at hip level.  Every being the circle touched sent that person to his knees, demanding solemn respect for the departed.  Teir’Dal the cavern over fell to offer their enforced respects for the fallen druid.  Even Glazin K’Jartan appeared forcibly reticent, much to Dreketh’s grim satisfaction.<br>
<br>
The clamor and confusion continuing unabated, the shadow knight stepped unchallenged amidst those of her race.  Without further word or ceremony, Xon Quexill, watched helpless as his daughter carried her companion through the inscribed doors to disappear from sight down the frozen passageway.  <br>
<br>
The necromancer’s service as custodian to the Pact of Zeranon was at an end.<br>

<c "#FFff00">Epilogue</c><br>
<br>
The Dark Elf sat alone upon the outcropping that overlooked the lush grasslands below.  With her legs crossed, forming an "X" before her, she rested her forearms on her knees, her hands held together loosely by their fingertips as she watched the autumn day go by – unusually warm for being so late in the season.<br>
<br>
I better enjoy it while it lasts, she thought to herself quietly, her eyes reflecting the clear blue of the cloudless sky with their own azure gaze to match.  Soon the gentle breeze that wafted the tendrils of her white hair from her face would turn frosty with the coming of winter's cruel bite.  Though Teir'Dal are not prone to suffer from the rigors of cold weather, this particular one had learned to hate even the slightest hint of chills down her spine, and passionately so.<br>
<br>
It wasn't always this way, she pondered.  In days long past, the cold used to herald the welcome arrival of night.  She used to detest the feeling of the sun's rays against her face.  It hurt her eyes, after all, and gave her a pounding headache that wouldn't go away. No self-respecting Teir'Dal would welcome that.  <br>
<br>
Even worse was the occasional downpour from a cloud-filled sky, drenching everything in sight until she was soaked clear through to the bone.  Roads turned to mud, hampering travel.  Lightning flared, blinding her sensitive eyes.  Rain or shine, it was always a burden.<br>
<br>
But she was no longer any typical Teir'Dal. She was a Teir'Dal who welcomed the sun's warming rays upon her face each morning, and found solace in the day's silent progression.  She was a Teir'Dal who recognized and even acknowledged virtues forever alien to her race – virtues not spawned of hatred.  Not even the clouds bothered her anymore, she thought, as the threat of rainfall presented the clear chance of catching rainwater straight from the sky with her tongue – an opportunity she never failed to take advantage of in her self-imposed isolation to the lands of South Karana.<br>
<br>
Though wary of the inhabitants to the north, Dreketh stayed well clear of any civilized land.  The southern areas of the plains remained, for the most part, unmolested by Human hands.  What few travelers she saw in the course of a week were distant and easily noticed from high in the mountaintop that was her home in exile.  Simply put, nobody came out this way, and that was exactly how the Dark Elf wanted it.<br>
<br>
Contrary to her thoughts, a shadow passed over Dreketh, blocking the sun that had worked its way behind her in the western sky.  A wry smile crossed the Dark Elf's lips for the first time in weeks.  <br>
<br>
"I knew you would find me," she said, still gazing out upon the green panorama rolling before her.<br>
<br>
The silent breeze rustled the man's robes who stood behind her, causing the heavy fabric to snap lightly as would a flag in a hearty wind.<br>
<br>
"A grand view," her father's voice spoke in its familiar baritone.  "I never could dissociate you from your obstinate taste for the romantic.  Or the sentimental."<br>
<br>
"I'm glad of it," Dreketh replied, still not turning around.  <br>
<br>
Moments passed as the necromancer's robes continued to flap about in the ceaseless breeze.<br>
<br>
“I thought you might wish to know, Tunare’s army has dispersed,” Quexill informed her.  “Upon the completion of the Pact, the Elves formally withdrew their support of the war effort.  With the threat of annihilation gone with the destruction of Zeranon’s Chalice, they could no longer justify genocide of a people.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh blinked slowly, not so much as acknowledging that the necromancer had spoken.<br>
<br>
“Things have returned to normal,” Quexill continued.  “As with Zeranon’s crusade two thousand years ago, Norrath has again stood on the brink of disaster with only a handful of people who realize just how close it all came to ending.”<br>
<br>
“Or who gave their lives for it,” the shadow knight said, her voice dire.<br>
<br>
The necromancer nodded quietly, allowing several moments for the wind to carry Dreketh’s words on its currents.<br>
<br>
“Many regrets,” he muttered.<br>
<br>
“Don’t speak to me of regrets, custodian,” the shadow knight said dourly.  “In Highpass, when you told me I would have to kill Tunare’s advocate, you knew how she would die.  You’d seen the visions of prophecy, and placed it under the false pretense of a struggle for power, not a mercy killing.”<br>
<br>
“Yes,” the necromancer admitted.<br>
<br>
“You lied to me.”<br>
<br>
“As did you, daughter.”<br>
<br>
Dreketh cast a scowl up at the man’s silhouette, silently demanding that he explain his accusation.<br>
<br>
“You had no intention of destroying your friend,” Quexill stated simply.  “Yet you would have had me believe otherwise.  Together, you schemed to destroy the Chalice long before leaving the keep.  It is why I insisted you enter the vault under threat of death.  Like the goddess, I too knew what was in your heart, daughter.”<br>
<br>
Squinting in the sunlight, brow furrowed in displeasure, Dreketh resumed her grim fix on the panorama.<br>
<br>
“Nevertheless, as custodian I did use and manipulate you.  You and the druid both,” the necromancer conceded, following her gaze.  “As your custodian it was my duty.  But as your father, I have failed you.  I’m deeply sorry for it, Dreketh.  I hope some day you can find it within yourself to forgive me for my part in what happened that day.”<br>
<br>
The shadow knight closed her eyes, betraying nothing of her thoughts as she absorbed his words.  The two Teir’Dal remained quietly on the outcropping, allowing the moments to pass as evening approached.<br>
<br>
"Be that as it may, I come seeking to know one thing, and one thing only," Quexill said, breaking the silence.  "Then I will respectfully leave you in peace, never to disturb you again, if that is your wish."<br>
<br>
"What is it?" came Dreketh's quiet response.<br>
<br>
"Do you ever intend to straighten your room?  It's a dreadful eyesore."<br>
<br>
Looking up, Dreketh cast her surrogate father a dour look for his flippancy, only to encounter a fond smile spreading across the man's striking face.  The image was too much for the brooding Dark Elf, who hurriedly turned to away.  Purely of its own accord, a smirk wedged itself through her airtight defenses.<br>
<br>
"I miss that wardrobe," she said under her breath, thinking of the many shirts, pants and robes she'd left scattered about her quarters before leaving Neriak that first day. <br>
<br>
"I thought as much," Quexill replied.  "That is why I have seen fit to bring it along with me.  Space is at a premium in the Lodge of the Dead, and it was either bring your belongings to you or burn them.  The latter I found unsettling, so I instead opted for the former."<br>
<br>
Once again looking up to the master necromancer's careworn face, Dreketh uncrossed her legs to stand and embrace her father.<br>
<br>
"Thank you for coming," she whispered, holding tight.<br>
<br>
"You're quite welcome," Quexill replied, loathe to end their embrace.<br>
<br>
But end it did as Dreketh pulled back to look at her father's face, her fingers caressing his cheek in much the same way hers had been touched so many weeks before.  The profound meaning of that gesture was not lost on the master necromancer, as he reached up to take her hand in his own.  Bringing it to his lips, he kissed it tenderly.<br>
<br>
"The pain of loss has not yet passed," he observed.  "But you must trust me, Dreketh, when I tell you that it will.  It will."<br>
<br>
Dreketh shook her head sadly.  "I don't want it to go away.  I need it to linger within me and foster that small part of her soul that's still inside."  She brought her fingers up to tap lightly against her own chest.  "I feel her, father.  Right here.  The portion of her soul I tapped still exists within me.  Do you know how hard it was to lay her to rest, knowing that?"  The young woman’s eyes started filling with tears as she spoke, as it had so many countless times since the end of the Pact.<br>
<br>
Taking her twice in his arms, Xon Quexill held his daughter close to his chest, allowing the painful sobs of her grief to abate of their own accord.<br>
<br>
"I know," he muttered, soothing her.  "I know, indeed."<br>
<br>
Again, the whispering winds of the mountainside blew across the two Dark Elves as each sought refuge in the comforting silence of the plains.<br>
<br>
"Is she here?" the necromancer asked calmly.<br>
<br>
Nodding, Dreketh pulled away with a quick sniff of her nose.  "Up past the hut," she said, pointing vaguely in the direction of her self-made dwelling.  <br>
<br>
"Is it marked?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, of course it is."<br>
<br>
"Good."<br>
<br>
"Why's that good?"  she asked, swiping at her nose with the back of her sleeve.<br>
<br>
"Because of a debt I believe you owe someone who would greatly benefit from visiting her resting place," the necromancer said.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dreketh found the acolyte kneeling before Laera's headstone, his head bowed solemnly.  Quexill had said the foolhardy young acolyte was discovered at the edge of Nektulos Forest, defiantly demanding an audience with the guild master by name.  Scant moments before he fell under the blade of the guards, Quexill interceded on the impetuous boy’s behalf.<br>
<br>
He claimed his name was Rigel, and demanded of the master necromancer that he be taken to his friend's grave immediately, tears marring his face.  As he was already planning to visit Dreketh anyway, Quexill agreed to allow the stalwart youth to accompany him.<br>
<br>
Though the name hadn't rung a bell to Dreketh, she recognized the young Elf immediately as the one who discovered her with Laera in Greater Faydark just outside of Kelethin.  Clear memories of their dealings with him were resurrected, reminding her again of fonder days when her companion lived.<br>
<br>
As Dreketh approached, the oblivious Wood Elf laid a single piece of parchment on the ground next to the headstone, placing a smooth rock on top to keep it from fluttering away in the wind.  Nearing., she was curious to note it was a letter written in crisp, flawless handwriting across the page.<br>
<br>
"Hello," she said, calling attention to herself.<br>
<br>
Turning abruptly at the unexpected voice, Rigel caught sight of the Dark Elf's face.<br>
<br>
"It's you," he said, his tone wholly uninviting.<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry if I interrupted," Dreketh continued, her voice genuine to her feelings.<br>
<br>
"It's okay," the Wood Elf answered curtly, hurrying to wipe at his face with a smudged hand.  "I was finished saying what I was going to say, anyway."<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf nodded, her eyes straying the headstone along with the young Elf's as the two stood before the shrine dedicated to the one thing they had in common – their devout and truest friend.<br>
<br>
Sniffling once again, Rigel posed his question.  "So, what does it say?"<br>
<br>
Not understanding at first, Dreketh cast the Wood Elf a quizzical look.  Her confusion was short lived, however, at seeing his gaze riveted to the words written in Teir'Dal on the headstone.<br>
<br>
"What sets gods asunder, shall set the spirit free," she interpreted.  "Here lies Laera Nellynwae, freest spirit to exist on Norrath."<br>
<br>
Lower lip quivering, Rigel stood unmoving as tears again continued to flow down his cheeks.<br>
<br>
Seeing this, Dreketh broke the awkward silence.<br>
<br>
"You know… Laera mourned the loss of that insipid orc she'd found in Crushbone for days after we left.  She said she'd felt robbed of being able to grieve because she never had the time to really get to know him.  I couldn't fathom what she meant, and dismissed it as being frivolous to the task at hand."<br>
<br>
Swallowing, Dreketh glanced down to her feet against the scrub of the rocky terrain.<br>
<br>
"But now, I envy you, Wood Elf," she said, her voice barely audible.  "You knew Laera in a way I never will.  You loved her for who she was before the Pact.  Before the darkness and the blood that so colored her nature after meeting me."<br>
<br>
Rigel offered no comment, the young acolyte's eyes fixed on the stone before him.<br>
<br>
"I find myself echoing her thoughts now," Dreketh continued, her voice quivering.  "I feel robbed of being able to grieve her loss, because the Laera Nellynwae I knew…"  The Dark Elf paused, choked by her own tears.  "…wasn't who she really was."<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf looked over to the pained Teir'Dal – the same Teir'Dal who had taken Larea away from him.  The same Teir'Dal who twisted his kindhearted friend into someone who only vaguely resembled the person he knew.  This was the Teir'Dal whose very hand shattered Rigel's world by killing his beloved schoolmate.  And here she was weeping before his very eyes, even as he.<br>
<br>
A voice in the back of his head told him that this wasn't the way Laera knew Dreketh, nor would she wish him to see her in such a light.  Head Mistress Netheel told Rigel of Laera's willingness to lay down her life for love of this Teir'Dal.  Obviously his friend's devotion was not unrequited.<br>
<br>
"Then let me to tell you of the Laera Nellynwae I knew," he said.<br>
<br>
Dreketh looked up in disbelief.  Seeing the young man's serious face nod in confirmation of his own words, she sat on the ground near her companion's shrine as the sun set to the west.  Rigel retrieved his letter, folding it carefully and placing it in his pocket as he sat across from the Teir'Dal.<br>
<br>
Licking his lips, he began.  "Laera Nellynwae was the kindest, most vibrant friend anyone could wish for…"<br>
<br>
Dreketh closed her eyes, allowing her imagination to drift along with the young Elf’s words.  Vivid memories of her devout friend pervaded the Teir’Dal’s mind, allowing her to see fully well that with every breath, the acolyte spoke the absolute truth.<br>

<c "#FFff00">Author's note</c><br>
<br>
The Pact of Zeranon was, for lack of a better term, an accident.  It all began when my wife and I decided to play EverQuest together one day on the Test Server.  She had a Wood Elf druid and I played a Dark Elf shadow knight.  Both were female, roughly level 9, and neither was doing particularly well hunting on their own.<br>
<br>
Purist roleplayers that we were, it was important to us that there be an explanation for why a druid of Tunare and shadow knight of Innoruuk would suffer each other’s company long enough to cook dinner, much less journey across Norrath.  Many extenuating scenarios wandered across the table in our negotiations, all of which were nauseatingly cliché and had been done a thousand times before.  For all practical purposes, a Wood Elf and Dark Elf wouldn’t last five minutes without ending up at each other’s throats unless some divine intervention caused them to lose their heads and actually protect each other instead.<br>
<br>
The Pact of Zeranon was born.  It was a golden opportunity to indulge in two characters who embodied the ultimate love/hate relationship, and we played it out to a fault.  Before long, the antics of the two unseemly companions and their unique relationship took on a life all its own.  Actions spawned ideas, and the characters became so engrossing that it dawned on me that I really should be writing it all down somewhere.<br>
<br>
This being my first stab at writing a novel-length story, I’ve learned a great deal.  First and foremost, I learned that I positively adore writing fiction.  As a narrow second, I learned that having someone read my fiction for the first time is the most terrifying thing I’ve ever done in my life.  In so doing, I’ve discovered a profound respect for anyone who has the raw courage to do it – amateur or professional.<br>
<br>
I also learned that writing fiction isn’t so much inventing a story as it is merely telling one that already exists in the eyes and minds of your characters.  As a reader of fiction, I’d naturally become accustomed to how these figments of our imagination weave their way into our hearts no less than if they were actual people.  What I didn’t expect was to discover how true this is for authors as well.  I found myself blindsided by how spiritually rewarding it can be to share in my characters’ victories, and even more sobering at how painful it can be to mourn their deaths.  I can’t explain it, except to say that you have to experience it to fully appreciate it.<br>
<br>
That being said, The Pact of Zeranon has been the singularly most rewarding project I have ever undertaken.  Due to copyright issues over intellectual property, and knowing the way Verant Interactive does business, it will likely never be published in hardcopy.  Realizing this from the beginning, it was always intended as a labor of love for sake of the story and my own belief that it deserved to be told.  In the end, I think I gained more from telling it than I would have ever thought possible.<br>
<br>
Because of this, I owe my gratitude to a staggering number of people who provided their support and inspiration.  Profound thanks go to my friends and family – a forgiving audience who weathered endless rough drafts and revamped manuscripts.  In particular, I want my wife Jennifer to know how much I value her honesty, her insight, and for pinch-hitting as proofreader in the absence of a professional.  Also, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to my father Glen for his boundless enthusiasm in the telling of this story.  <br>
<br>
I would also like to extend my appreciation to my favorite authors Michael Moorcock, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, Anne McCaffrey, Robert Asprin, and the ever-inspiring Terry Goodkind, as well as the recently deceased Douglas Adams.  (Rest in peace, Douglas… you made an entire galaxy laugh.)<br>
<br>
Music is often a powerful source of inspiration for me as I write.  My awe-filled thanks go to such composers as Vangelis, Bjorn Lynne, Christopher Franke, Marty Simon, Velton Ray Bunch, and Eric Serra for sharing their sonorous gifts.<br>
<br>
Allow me to thank Oghma and the staff of OtherWorld Express for their stimulating periodical, and for giving The Pact of Zeranon its first run at web publication.  <br>
<br>
Finally, I would like to thank Laera and Dreketh themselves for picking me to tell their story.<br>
<br>
When all is said and done, this is pretty much the definitive version of the Pact of Zeranon.  Those of you who are familiar with the OWX version (under the pen name “Shadoe”) will note a few minor changes to some segments here and there from that earlier version.  Without attesting to any improvement in quality, I will say that no story is ever truly finished.  No… not by a long shot.  <br>
<br>
I do hope you enjoy this tale and send me lots and lots of money so I can retire a wealthy man with more than a half-grown turnip to my name as I grow old and gray.<br>
<br>
(Hey, it could happen…)<br>
