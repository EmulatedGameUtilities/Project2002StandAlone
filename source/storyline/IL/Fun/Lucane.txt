The Turning of Sir Lucan: Part One - The Kunark Expedition       <BR>

For those of you who appreciate roleplaying and think I only write comedy... here's a story I originally posted on Allakhazam on my friend Pusbag's journal. Enjoy! <BR>
<BR>
P.S. I know this does not follow the "official" lore of the game, but I always thought their original explanation of Sir Lucan was lame. <BR>

<BR>
In the early days, Freeport was a human city that thrived on its legal trade, and it was a safe haven for all those who served the forces of good. All were welcome there, as long as they did not worship the evil gods or turn on their fellow citizens. The city prospered and at first the gods smiled on its inhabitants – all the gods, that is, but one: Innorruuk, god of hate. <BR>
<BR>
Innorruuk loathed the holy servants of Mithaniel and Errollisi Marr who built their magnificent city on the coast of Antonica. He knew that Freeport and its army of paladins stood between his servants in Neriak and the conquest of all of Eastern Antonica. Without controlling the coastline, the dark elf minions of hate could not threaten the twin elf cities of Felwithe and Kelethin on the neighboring continent of Faydwer. Even with the cooperation of the ogres and trolls, the dark elves simply could not drive the humans out. At the heart of the effort of the humans to keep the evil forces at bay was a noble young paladin named Sir Lucan. Sir Lucan was handsome and brave, and the people of Freeport rallied around him whenever he called the people to arms to fight off the forces of darkness. As time passed on, the people became more and more dependent on Sir Lucan, and the young paladin began to thrive on the adoration and acclamations of his fellow citizens. <BR>
<BR>
It was here that Innorruuk saw his chance. Perhaps if Sir Lucan could be slain, then his influence over the humans of Freeport could be broken and the city might fall. Enlisting the help of Bertoxxulous, Innorruuk decided to send a plague of rats to the city to spread disease, and then an army of undead to wipe out the weakened survivors. But Sir Lucan sent out a call for help and soon enlisted the help of other paladins from around Norrath. The first people to respond were the nearby Dwarves from across the sea, who sent a mighty army of paladins, clerics and warriors to help their beleaguered friends. As reinforcements poured into Freeport, the undead army was defeated and Innorruk was humiliated. Bertoxxulous was more than happy to send his minions of decay and disease after the defeated armies of Innorruuk – it mattered not to him whether his worms fed on the flesh of humans or that of dark elves. Infuriated at the defeat handed to him, Innorruuk decided a more subtle approach was needed and thus he began to plot to overthrow both Lucan and the dwarves who had come to his rescue. <BR>
<BR>
The opportunity came with the kidnapping of Firiona Vie, champion of Tunare, by the Iksar of Kunark. A massive expedition was planned by the high elves under General Jyleel to invade Kunark and rescue her. The humans and dwarves also contributed to this force, with the contingent of human Paladins commanded by Sir Lucan and a contingent of dwarven Paladins commanded by Amaral Bellhewer. The armada set sail from Butcherblock to the coast of Kunark, where the army landed at a lonely beach not far from the smoldering and now deserted elven outpost. With the help of dwarven masons and human woodcutters, the high elves built a magnificent fortress town on the ruins of the old settlement. They named it Firiona Vie, after the beautiful goddess they had come to rescue. From here, they gathered supplies and planned their attack on the Iksar fortress where Firiona Vie was being held. <BR>
<BR>
The Turning of Sir Lucan: Part Two - Lucan’s Betrayal       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
The great army of elves, dwarves and men made its way across the wilderness of Kunark, constantly skirmishing with small bands of Iksar. The Iksar knew they had to buy time in order to gather enough troops to resist the enormous army that had landed without warning. Their forces were being slowly whittled down. At long last the Iksar came to realize that they could not fight their traditional enemies, the sarnaks and goblins, and this new foe simultaneously. They realized that they must win a quick victory over the invaders or all would be lost. They prayed to their god Cazic Thule for help in their hour of need. Cazic Thule heard their prayers, but help came from an unexpected source. A human cleric named Brother Jentry had secretly been recruited by Innorruuk. Posing as a loyal follower of Mithaniel Marr, this cleric attempted to ingratiate himself with the leaders of the expedition. Although both General Jyleel and Amaral Bellhewer sensed something was wrong with this cleric, Sir Lucan allowed Brother Jentry to become his most trusted aide. The cleric constantly fed Sir Lucan’s vanity with praise and flattery, for the paladin had grown haughty with his continued battlefield triumphs. Subtly influenced by Innorruuk through Brother Jentry, the noble paladin began to grow jealous of the other leaders of the Kunark expedition, particularly Amaral Bellhewer. Appointed by the King of the dwarves to lead the dwarven forces in Kunark, Bellhewer was already a seasoned holy warrior of Brell with many campaigns behind him, and he was regarded as a hero by dwarves, elves and humans alike. When the humans and elves cheered the dwarven general after a bloody skirmish, Sir Lucan became angry. With no one to hear him but Brother Jentry, Sir Lucan vowed to make himself the sole hero of the rescue expedition, even if it meant the death of Amaral Bellhewer. <BR>
<BR>
Innorruuk, still waiting for his chance to strike back at those who had angered him, now saw an opportunity. He had planned to use Brother Jentry to kill Sir Lucan in his sleep, but he now saw an opportunity to bring something to Sir Lucan even worse than death – humiliation. He saw a way to inflict same stinging humiliation and defeat that he, Innorruuk, had suffered back onto Sir Lucan. <BR>
<BR>
Careful to not draw undue attention from any of the other gods, Innorruuk made a secret pact with Cazic Thule, the god of fear. In return for assisting the Iksar to drive out the invaders, Innorruuk asked that Cazic Thule use his power to both shame Sir Lucan and to make sure that the army of dwarves, who had also offended him, suffered a stinging defeat and annihilation. The bargain was set and the two evil gods began to set their plan in motion. <BR>
<BR>
Revealing himself to the Iksar high priests, Cazic Thule instructed them to place Firiona Vie in a remote site, where she would be used as bait to lure the rescue expedition into a trap. A guard of highly skilled Iksar warriors and monks was placed around her, so as to make a convincing fight to the rescuers. Meanwhile, the now united Iksar armies lay in wait nearby, ready to strike when the rescue force came for Firiona Vie. <BR>
<BR>
The trap worked perfectly. After a brief but hard-fought battle, Firiona Vie was rescued by the high elves of Felwithe, who had their flanks protected by the humans under Sir Lucan on the left and the dwarves under Amaral Bellhewer on the right. It was then that the Iksar sprung their trap. Swarms of Iksar descended on the rescue force, who were now surrounded. Now Innorruuk stepped in and raised the slain Iksar from the dead. This undead army added great numbers to the foes of the rescue force, and their lines began to break. <BR>
<BR>
Amaral Bellhewer saw that the situation was grim, and thus he led a great charge into the ranks of the Iksar and their zombies to clear a path for the army to escape. Surging ahead to the beach, the high elves whisked Firiona Vie away on a ship as the dwarves and humans fought a desperate rear guard action. <BR>
<BR>
Furious that the champion of Tunare had escaped, Cazic Thule and Innorruuk put the rest of their plan into motion immediately. In a great final effort, Cazic Thule put a tremendous fear into the hearts of the humans under Sir Lucan, and most of them fled the battlefield, despite all attempts by Sir Lucan to rally them. They swam out to their ships and begged the crews to return them to Freeport. <BR>
<BR>
Having finally defeated his longtime nemesis, Innorruuk now set in motion the final part of his plan. The dwarves under Amaral Bellhewer were now isolated on the beach, the high elves under General Jyleel having withdrawn by ship to return to their outpost at Firiona Vie with the town’s namesake. The humans, having now recovered from their fear, asked to return to the beach to pick up their dwarven comrades. They looked to Sir Lucan to give the next order. But Sir Lucan’s will was sapped and his courage faltered. He could not believe that the expedition to Kunark would end in disaster in such a way. All he needed was a gentle push to send him falling into darkness. Through his servant Brother Jentry, Innorruk now swayed the heart of Sir Lucan away from good forever. With his deceitful tongue, Brother Jentry persuaded Sir Lucan that all was lost, and the honorable thing for Sir Lucan to do was to save the rest of his army by withdrawing immediately. If the dwarves were trapped on the beach and wiped out, well then it was the fault of that wicked dwarven general of theirs. Sir Lucan, still smarting over his perceived embarassment and eager to restore his tarnished military reputation, gave the orders for the ships to withdraw, saying that all surviving members of the expedition had been picked up. The steadily dwindling dwarven army on the beach watched the remaining ships set sail and head west, away from them. <BR>
<BR>
A small number of men and elves stood fast with their dwarven comrades. Among these were Yeolarn Bronzeleaf of Felwithe and Valeron Dushire of Freeport. Yeolarn had elected to remain with the rear guard when the rest of the High Elves had withdrawn to Firiona Vie. Valeron had been one of the few human paladins to not succumb to Cazic Thule's fear and had also chosen to remain with the rear guard. These two paladins and their companions fought bravely by the side of their dwarven fellows even as they realized that they had been abandoned by Sir Lucan. <BR>
<BR>
It was at this moment that Amaral Bellhewer was mortally wounded. His wife Jenette, a cleric who had been tending the wounded at the water's edge, heard the cry from the front of the battle line that her husband had fallen. She rushed past the retreating dwarves, elves and men to find Valeron Dushire carrying her husband's sword and his now cloven helm. Defying the warning cries of all that called out to her to come back, she ran to find her husband's corpse. <BR>
<BR>
But not all hope was lost. After the last of the elven vessels had headed to the outpost at Firiona Vie and the rest of the fleet had headed back to Freeport, two ships remained behind. Their captains were a pair of halfling brothers who were renowned both for their seamanship and their unconventional thinking. They ordered their ships to return to the beach to see if anyone else remained. The first vessel picked up the wounded that had been brought to the beach. The eldest sons of Amaral and Jenette Bellhewer refused to leave until their parents returned. The captain of the second vessel agreed to stay with them as long as he could as the first vessel weighed its anchor and set sail for Butcherblock. As the first vessel headed out to sea, the young halfling captain waved goodbye to his brother on the other vessel. It was the last anyone would see of the second ship or any of the survivors on the beach.<BR>
 <BR>
The Turning of Sir Lucan: Part Three - Freeport       <BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 <BR>
The last ship that returned to Freeport brought a tale of woe. The survivors that were crowded aboard the vessel told how they had watched the rest of the fleet sail away even as they were loading the wounded onto the deck. They had been forced to leave behind a small number of dwarves who had insisted that they would retrieve their captain, Amaral Bellhewer, dead or alive. The halfling captain of the vessel wept as he told how his brother, also a captain, had elected to stay behind and wait for the dwarves to return to the beach. <BR>
<BR>
By now the tale of betrayal had spread throughout the ranks of the allied armies, and sentiment turned against Sir Lucan, even among his own people. A meeting of the advisory council of all the paladins of Freeport voted to expel Sir Lucan from their order, as he had betrayed the trust of all. Sir Lucan was now fully in the grip of the forces of darkness and he knew there was no turning back. He vowed he would remake Freeport in his own image, and so he began to recruit an army of vagabonds, thieves, and mercenaries to overthrow the paladins of Freeport. Soon, he had created a force large enough to challenge the protective grip that the good paladins and clerics held over the human city. This new force, called the Freeport Militia, owed its allegiance to Sir Lucan and him only. Initially the conflict was kept in the shadows, and most of the residents of the city were not fully aware of the civil war in their midst. Eventually, the fighting came out in the open, and much of the city resisted choosing sides. Without knowing who would prevail, the residents of the city feared that choosing a side would mean their banishment from the city once the war was over. Thus much of the city attempted to stay neutral as best they could and offered little help. Without the support of the population, the paladins were in trouble. Sir Lucan controlled both city gates and the docks as well. They were cut off from the rest of the world. They had lost many of their number in Kunark and did not have enough time to replenish their ranks. Sir Lucan, on the other hand, was able to swell the numbers of the Freeport Militia by recruiting widely amongst the criminal elements not only in Freeport but also across the entire human population of Antonica. The forces of good were driven into the northern parts of the city near their guildhalls. They managed to fight off repeated attacks by the Freeport Militia over a period of several months. Eventually the two sides settled into an informal cease-fire, with each side remaining within its own area of control within Freeport. Although open conflict has not taken place in some twenty years, there is still much tension and each side still hunts down members of the opposition when they can. <BR>
<BR>
The mortals of Norrath were not the only ones who chose sides. Mithaniel Marr had seen what had happened, and was particularly grieved at the turning of his loyal follower Sir Lucan. He vowed that his temple in Freeport would never fall to Sir Lucan and his Freeport Militia. It was his powers and those of his sister Erollisi Marr that prevented Sir Lucan from prevailing over the paladins of Freeport. These gods decided that they must enlist the help of all their followers to destroy Sir Lucan. With the assistance of Prexus, Brell Serilis, and Quellious, they created a plan by which all true paladins must prove their worth… by killing Sir Lucan.<BR>
